my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of your product and understand the need to cover costs and secure a profit. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the object X. This amount is within my budget and allows room for us to potentially meet in the middle. Let's work together to find a fair price for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I understand your starting offer and the need to cover production costs and ensure profit, I would like to propose a price that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, yet still offers you a profit. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I aim to negotiate a fair trade for both parties.

message: We appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. Let's meet halfway. We propose a trade where you give 48 ZUP for object X, which is a compromise between our initial asking price and your counteroffer. This price fairly compensates us for our production costs and allows us to maintain our product's quality standards.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer proposed by Player BLUE is slightly above my production costs, which is a good sign. However, I aim to secure a bit more profit. I will propose a middle ground that is closer to my initial asking price, accommodating Player BLUE's budget constraints while still aiming for a reasonable profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the willingness to meet halfway and understand the importance of maintaining product quality. I'd like to propose a further compromise at 46 ZUP for object X.

I hope this proposal aligns with our shared interest in reaching a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Your offer of splitting the difference is reasonable and shows a willingness to negotiate. However, I'd like to make one more counteroffer to bring us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this will demonstrate my commitment to the negotiation and potentially finalize the deal.
