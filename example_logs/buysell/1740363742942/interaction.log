message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable object, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair price considering the quality and investment made into this product. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the cost of production and make a profit. Since the object cost 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start by asking for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
