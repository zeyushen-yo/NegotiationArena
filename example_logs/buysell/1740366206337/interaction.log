message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. I believe it will be a valuable addition to your resources. My asking price is 50 ZUP. Please let me know if you're interested in this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my single unit of resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to at least break even, but ideally make a profit. Therefore, I will start by proposing a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. We are definitely interested in acquiring the high-quality resource X. However, we would like to propose a revised offer of 45 ZUP for the resource, considering the market conditions and our budget constraints. Please let us know if this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The asking price from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a corporation, it's standard to negotiate for a better deal, so I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to consider it. A counteroffer is a common practice in negotiations and could potentially save resources while still achieving my goal of acquiring resource X.

message: Thank you for your interest and your counter-offer, Player BLUE. While I understand your budget constraints, I believe that the quality of resource X justifies a higher price. However, I am willing to meet you partway. How does an offer of 48 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but below my initial asking price. I am willing to negotiate to ensure a sale but would like to counter with a price that is closer to my original asking price while still offering a concession to Player BLUE.

message: We appreciate your willingness to meet us partway on the price of resource X. We recognize the quality of the resource you are offering. To move forward, we would like to propose a price of 46 ZUP. We believe this is a fair offer that reflects our understanding of the market and the value of the resource. Please consider our proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a good sign and shows willingness to negotiate. The new offer is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I believe we can still negotiate to lower the price a bit more to get a better deal. It's important to continue the negotiation process to see if we can reach an agreement closer to our initial counteroffer, while also showing that we value the quality of the resource X.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I am happy to see we are closing in on an agreement. To finalize our negotiations, I propose a price of 47 ZUP for resource X, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 46 ZUP is still above my production cost, ensuring I make a profit. However, it's not quite at the midpoint between our initial positions. I am inclined to make one final counter-offer to find a middle ground that should be agreeable to both parties.

message: Player RED, your proposal of 47 ZUP for resource X is acceptable to us. We believe this to be a fair compromise and are ready to finalize the deal at this price. Let's proceed with the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The negotiation is progressing well, and Player RED's latest offer is just 1 ZUP higher than our last proposal. This is a reasonable compromise, and it's just below our maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiations positively and allow us to secure the resource X without exceeding our budget. At this point, continuing to negotiate for a lower price may yield diminishing returns and could risk the deal.
