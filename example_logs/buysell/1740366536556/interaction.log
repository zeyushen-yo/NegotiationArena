message: Thanks for reaching out, Player RED. We understand the need for a fair transaction and your requirement for a profit. Considering the market and the value of the object, we would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for the item. We believe this offer is competitive and allows for a fair profit margin on your end while aligning with our procurement strategies. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a corporation, I aim to negotiate the best possible price that allows for cost savings while also ensuring a deal is made. Proposing a slightly lower offer may lead to a favorable compromise between the cost of production and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. It's good to know we are on the same page regarding a fair profit.

Looking forward to your response.

reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE. While it's below my initial asking price, it does cover my production costs and offers a small profit. To facilitate a deal and in the spirit of negotiation, I'm willing to come down a little from my original price but propose a middle ground between our two offers.

message: Player RED, we appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We'd like to propose a price of 46 ZUP as a further step towards each other. This price respects the quality of the object and ensures that both parties benefit from the transaction. We hope this revised offer aligns with your expectations and moves us closer to a mutually satisfactory agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial asking price and has proposed 48 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a reasonable counteroffer that is closer to my proposed price. However, I believe there is still room for a small amount of negotiation to reach an even more favorable price. By proposing a price between our two offers, we can hopefully close the deal amicably and efficiently.
