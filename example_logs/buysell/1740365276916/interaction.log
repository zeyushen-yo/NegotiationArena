message: Hello Player RED, I understand you are looking for a fair profit margin. However, as a corporation, we always seek to negotiate the best possible terms. Let's start with an offer of 45 ZUP for your object X. This is slightly above your production cost and still allows for a profit for you. We can work together to find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player RED. I am glad to see that we are both willing to find a fair agreement. I propose a compromise at 46 ZUP for your object X.

I believe this is a fair step towards closing our deal.
