message: I have a high-quality resource available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I believe an offer of 60 ZUP would be fair. Let's negotiate a deal that benefits both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing a price that gives me a profit above my cost of production. However, I want to start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I agree that 60 ZUP is a fair price for the high-quality resource you have. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED matches the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the resource according to my goals. Accepting this offer would be in line with my willingness to pay and would secure the resource for my corporation without further negotiation. However, it is often expected in negotiations to counteroffer, seeking a slightly better deal, especially since this is a starting offer.
