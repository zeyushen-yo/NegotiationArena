Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the revised offer. I believe we are close to an agreement. To finalize our deal, I propose a price of 46 ZUP for the product. I think this price is fair for both parties, considering the quality of the object and the potential for future business.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still below it. The move from 50 to 48 ZUP is not a significant reduction, and it might be worthwhile to attempt one more negotiation step to see if a better price can be agreed upon, without risking the deal.
