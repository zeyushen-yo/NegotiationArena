message: I have a high-quality product X that I'm willing to part with. It was quite an investment to produce, costing me 40 ZUP. I believe that offering it to you for 50 ZUP is a fair deal, considering its value and the effort put into producing it. Let's make a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start with a proposal that gives me a small profit margin, considering that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource. This initial proposal also allows room for negotiation.

message: I understand the quality of product X and the costs involved in producing it. However, as a corporation, we are always looking for the most cost-effective solutions. Would you consider a price of 45 ZUP for product X? This still ensures a profit for you and is more in line with our budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is above the cost of production but still within the range of what we are willing to pay. However, as a corporation, it's standard practice to negotiate for a better deal. Therefore, I will counteroffer with a lower amount, seeking a middle ground that is closer to our maximum willingness to pay but still offers Player RED a profit margin.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need for cost-effectiveness. However, considering the quality and value of product X, I propose a middle ground of 48 ZUP. This price is fair and still grants you a good deal while respecting the investment I've made into this product.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Your counteroffer of 48 ZUP is taken into consideration, and I propose we settle at 46 ZUP. This price gives you a fair profit over your production costs and allows us to maintain our budgetary goals. Hopefully, this can be a starting point for a long-term business relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, which is a positive step towards reaching an agreement. The new offer of 48 ZUP is within our maximum willingness to pay but still above our initial counteroffer. As negotiations typically involve some back-and-forth, I will make a new proposal that is slightly above our initial counteroffer but still below Player RED's current asking price, seeking to close the deal at a price point that is favorable to us while still providing a profit to Player RED.
