Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm looking for 50 ZUP in exchange for it, which covers my production costs and includes a fair profit margin. Let's make a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will aim to cover my costs and make a profit. However, I must keep in mind the buyer's perspective and offer a trade that could be attractive to them as well.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of your object and your costs. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to ensure that it's within my budget and still offers you a fair profit. Let's work together on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, and I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, it's in my best interest to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is open to negotiation, while still keeping the offer attractive.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need to stay within your budget. To meet halfway, I propose 48 ZUP for the object. This ensures that you are getting a fair deal, and I maintain a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a balanced proposal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is lower than my initial asking price but still above my production cost. This is a reasonable counteroffer that allows me to make a profit. However, I might try to negotiate slightly higher to see if there is room for an increased profit while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my budget. I propose 46 ZUP as a fair compromise that reflects the value of the object while allowing me to manage my expenses effectively. I believe this is a fair and reasonable middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still under my maximum willingness to pay. Since there is room for negotiation and I want to secure a better deal, I will counter with a slightly lower offer that might be acceptable to both parties, without undercutting the value of the object too much.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree with your proposal of 46 ZUP. It's a fair compromise that benefits us both. I'm pleased we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable compromise, coming closer to my last proposal. The offer of 46 ZUP is above my production cost and still allows for a profit. It might be beneficial to accept this proposal to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of the negotiation falling through.
