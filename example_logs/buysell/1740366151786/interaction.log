message: I have a high-quality resource available for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I am looking to sell it at a fair price that allows me to cover costs and make a profit. I believe 50 ZUP would be a reasonable starting point for negotiation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade to begin the negotiation process and aiming to cover my costs and make a profit. Since I do not know the corporation's willingness to pay, I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my production costs.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking to make a profit, and I'm interested in acquiring the high-quality resource you have. To start our negotiations, I propose 45 ZUP for the resource. This price allows for a profit above your production costs and may lead to a mutually beneficial relationship for future transactions. Let's find a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. However, it's in my best interest to attempt to negotiate a better deal, perhaps at a lower price, while keeping in mind that the seller is looking to make a profit. I will propose a slightly lower amount to open negotiations and see if there's room for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal of 45 ZUP. I understand the importance of establishing a profitable and ongoing relationship. I would like to propose a middle ground of 47 ZUP, which allows for a fair profit for myself while respecting the value you see in the resource. This price also sets a positive precedent for potential future transactions between us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE. The offer is above my production cost, which meets my initial goal. However, I aimed for a higher profit margin to account for potential negotiations. To continue the process and show willingness to compromise, I'll propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between our initial offers.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find middle ground. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the resource. This sets a strong foundation for our relationship, and I look forward to future transactions. Thank you for a fair and reasonable deal.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counterproposal from Player RED for 47 ZUP is very close to the initial 50 ZUP they suggested and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is also a fair increase from my initial proposal, showing willingness to negotiate from both sides. Accepting this offer could foster a good business relationship for future dealings. Since it's beneficial to secure a deal that's below my maximum threshold and still allows for future negotiation room, I will accept this offer.
