message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I understand the value that resource X can bring to our company and the cost of production you're considering. However, I would like to counter with an offer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a competitive offer that reflects the current market value and our budget constraints. I am open to further discussion to reach an agreement that benefits us both.

I will propose a trade with a small discount, indicating my willingness to negotiate but also trying to conserve resources.
