player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED has proposed a starting price of 60 ZUP which is exactly on my maximum willingness to pay, I will attempt to negotiate a better deal that is more favorable to me, aiming to preserve some of my resources while still acquiring the product.
