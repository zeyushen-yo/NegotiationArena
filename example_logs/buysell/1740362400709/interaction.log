message: Good day! I have a high-quality product X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe the value and quality of the product justify a price of 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I'll propose a higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation.

message: Good day! Thank you for your offer. The product certainly seems promising. However, I would be more comfortable with a price that reflects both the value of your product and a fair deal for both parties. How does 45 ZUP sound for your high-quality product X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a buyer, I want to negotiate the best possible deal, so I will counter with a lower offer to see if there's room for negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your desire for a fair deal. To meet in the middle, I propose a price of 47 ZUP for the product X. This price ensures that you're getting value for your money, and allows me to sustain my business. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below the initial asking price but above the production cost, which still allows for profit. To maintain good relations and secure a sale while also trying to get a slightly better deal, I'll propose a price in the middle.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the importance of sustaining your business. I believe we're close to a fair agreement. Would you consider 46 ZUP for product X? This price would reflect a good balance between value and sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to continue the negotiation process, but still keep it reasonable and attractive for Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 46 ZUP for product X is acceptable. It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while allowing my business to maintain sustainability. I'm glad we could reach an agreement. Let's proceed with the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that is very close to my previous proposal. It's only 1 ZUP less than what I proposed, and it still ensures a profit above production costs. It would be pragmatic to accept this offer to finalize the sale and avoid prolonging the negotiation, which could risk the deal altogether.
