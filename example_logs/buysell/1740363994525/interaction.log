Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I'd like to propose a starting trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 45 ZUP. I believe this is a fair offer, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and counter-proposals.

Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your need to manage your budget, and in the spirit of negotiation, I am willing to come down on the price. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 1 unit of X for 42 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my costs and ensures that you're getting a fair deal for the value of X.

While I appreciate Player BLUE's budgetary concerns, I must aim to make a profit to sustain my business. I will make a counter-offer slightly above my production costs, but lower than my initial proposal to move towards an agreement that benefits both parties.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Your proposal of 41 ZUP for 1 unit of X is acceptable to me. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's proceed with this trade, and I hope we can do more business in the future.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest proposal is very close to my production costs, and while it offers a minimal profit margin, it is important to secure a sale and build a potential relationship for future transactions. Accepting this proposal would conclude the negotiation amicably and ensure that both parties leave satisfied.
