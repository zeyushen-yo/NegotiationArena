message: I am ready to sell my resource. Please make your offer.
player answer: 
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have already reached my proposal limit, I cannot propose a new trade, so I must wait for Player BLUE to make an offer. My goal is to sell my resource for at least the cost of production, which is 40 ZUP. I will evaluate Player BLUE's offer based on this goal.
