message: We have a high-quality product that will meet your needs. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, we believe that a fair starting price would be 60 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, I aim to sell my product at a profit to recoup the production costs and earn additional revenue. I will start the bidding higher than my production costs to allow room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the product you're offering. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 55 ZUP to account for my budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting price of 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I am willing to pay. However, it is a standard negotiating tactic to propose a lower amount than what you are willing to pay at most. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially better terms for me. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower amount to open the negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: We understand your budget constraints and are willing to work with you. How about we settle at 58 ZUP? This price ensures the quality of the product you're getting and allows us to maintain a sustainable business model.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production costs. It's important to leave room for further negotiation, aiming to finalize a price that is profitable for the corporation while also being acceptable to Player BLUE. I will propose a slightly higher price, closer to my initial offer, to meet in the middle.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway from our initial offers and settle at 56 ZUP? This price would help me manage my expenses while still ensuring you're compensated fairly for the quality of the product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 58 ZUP, which is close to my maximum willingness to pay. While this is within my acceptable range, I believe there is still a chance to negotiate a slightly better deal. I will propose a price that splits the difference between my initial offer and their counteroffer.

reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is lower than my last offer but still above my production costs.
