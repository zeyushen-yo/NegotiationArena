message: I have a high-quality product that I believe will meet your needs. I'm asking for 50 ZUP, which I think is a fair price considering the quality and production costs. Let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I want to make a profit, I will start by proposing a higher price than the production cost. However, I don't want to set the price too high as it might discourage the buyer. I will propose a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in the product, but I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP. I believe this is also a fair price, reflecting both the value of your product and my budget constraints. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my willingness to pay, however, it's always good to negotiate to try and get a better deal, especially since it's the beginning of the negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose we meet in the middle at 47 ZUP. This price still gives me a modest profit while respecting your budget. I hope this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is slightly above my production cost, which allows for a profit, but I believe I can negotiate a slightly higher price to increase the profit margin. I will propose a price in between the initial asking price and the counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: Your offer to meet in the middle at 47 ZUP sounds fair, and I am happy to accept this proposal. Thank you for your flexibility, and I'm looking forward to finalizing this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-proposal by suggesting we meet in the middle. The proposed price of 47 ZUP is still within my acceptable range and allows me to acquire the resource below my maximum willingness to pay. It's also beneficial to maintain a good relationship with the seller for possible future transactions.
