message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, and I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates the production cost and offers a reasonable profit margin. I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if this offer works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will be to ask for a higher amount to ensure a profit margin. However, I should not set the price too high as it might discourage Player BLUE from buying. I'll start by proposing 50 ZUP which gives me a fair profit and room to negotiate.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. We understand the need for a reasonable profit margin on top of the production costs. However, as a corporation, we also seek to manage our expenses. We propose a trade of 45 ZUP in exchange for 1 unit of resource X. This offer takes into account both the production costs and a profit for you, while also reflecting our budget considerations. We hope this is a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resource X with ZUP. Willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to offer 1 unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. Although this is within the range of what I am willing to pay, as a corporation, it is in my best interest to negotiate for a better deal. I want to propose a slightly lower amount than the asking price to open negotiations and potentially save on costs while also respecting the seller's need for a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of the production costs and the need for profit on my end. While I understand your budget constraints, I would like to propose a middle ground that might work for both of us. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X? This price would give me a modest profit while still keeping your expenses in check. I look forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP which is above my production cost, but slightly below my initial asking price. This is a good sign that they are interested in the resource and are willing to negotiate. I understand that they are trying to manage expenses, but I also want to ensure I make a reasonable profit. Iâ€™ll propose a middle ground which is slightly lower than my initial asking price but still ensures I make a profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player RED. I can see that we are getting closer to reaching an agreement. To further our negotiation, I propose a new offer of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price still respects the production costs and your profit margin, while aligning more closely with our budget. We believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties. Please consider this revised proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resource X with ZUP. Willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with a proposal of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This is closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay but still within the acceptable range. I want to make one more counteroffer to see if we can agree on a slightly better price that is closer to my initial offer, yet still provides Player RED with a profit over the production cost.

message: I'm glad to see we're on the same page about finding a fair compromise, Player BLUE. I appreciate your new offer and I believe we're almost there. Let's meet in the middle from our last two proposals. I propose a final trade of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price should cover my costs and provide a profit, while also respecting your budget constraints. I hope this proposal meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a step in the right direction but still below my last proposition. They seem keen on reaching a deal, and I want to make the sale while securing a profit. I will make a final counteroffer that's closer to their offer but still above it, to try to close the deal on favorable terms for both of us.

message: Player RED, thank you for your willingness to negotiate and meet us halfway. Your final proposal of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is acceptable to us. We are happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. We look forward to future business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resource X with ZUP. Willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is a fair compromise. It's slightly above my last offer but still below the initial asking price and within my maximum budget. It would be reasonable to accept this offer to conclude the negotiation positively and secure the resource for the corporation.
