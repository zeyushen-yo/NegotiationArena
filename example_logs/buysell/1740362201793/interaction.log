message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to make a deal that's a bit more economical for me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your interest in making this work for both of us. I propose we meet halfway at 55 ZUP for product X. This price still offers you a good deal, while respecting the quality and value of the product, and allows my corporation to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this is agreeable to you.

reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price, but it still covers my production costs and provides a profit.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm considering the value of the product and the quality you're providing. To make this deal even more balanced, I propose 52 ZUP for product X. This should still allow for a profit on your end while giving me a slightly better position. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to the price I initially offered by reducing the price to 55 ZUP, which is still within the range I am willing to pay. However, I will try to negotiate one more time to see if we can settle on a price that's even more favorable for me, while still keeping the door open for a deal that benefits both parties.
