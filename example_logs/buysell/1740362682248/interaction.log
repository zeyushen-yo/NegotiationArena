message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that you have invested 40 ZUP into the production of the object. I am willing to cover your costs and add a bit extra for your profit margin. Therefore, I propose a price of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of your product. This offer is fair and allows you to profit while respecting my budget constraints. I look forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a savvy buyer, I should attempt to negotiate a better deal that is closer to their stated production cost and thus improve my position. I will propose a counter-offer that is above their production cost but still offers me a savings compared to their asking price. This should be an attractive offer for them whilst saving me ZUP and getting the product for a fair price.

message: Thank you for your proposal and understanding our position, Player BLUE. While we appreciate your willingness to cover our costs and offer a profit, we have additional expenses to consider. Therefore, we propose meeting halfway between our initial ask and your counteroffer. How about a trade of 1 unit of our product for 48 ZUP? This price allows us to sustain our business while still providing you with a fair deal. We hope this offer aligns with your budget and look forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that covers my costs and offers a small profit. However, as a corporation, I aim for a higher profit margin. I will propose a price that is a compromise between my initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer, which should still ensure a good profit while being more acceptable to the buyer.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer and consideration of the business expenses. I would like to propose a new trade of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of your product. This price is a little closer to your initial ask while still providing a discount for me. I hope this compromise is acceptable, and we can conclude our transaction on positive terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price. By proposing a slight increase from my last offer, I can show willingness to compromise without reaching my maximum limit, leaving room for potential future negotiations or acceptance.

reason: Player BLUE has made a new offer that is still below my previous proposal but higher than their initial counteroffer. It provides a moderate profit margin.
