message: I have a high-quality product that required significant investment to produce. I believe that a price of 50 ZUP will reflect its value while also providing you with a good deal. Let's discuss terms that are beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm making an initial proposal that ensures I recover my production costs and gain a profit. Since this is a negotiation, I'm starting a bit higher to leave room for bargaining.
proposal count: 1

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality and value of the product you are offering. However, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the object. This offer takes into consideration my budget while still providing you with a fair compensation for your product. Let's work together to reach an agreement that suits both of our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am initiating the negotiation with a proposal that is slightly below my maximum willingness to pay to allow room for negotiation. Starting with a lower offer than my maximum allows me to potentially save on costs while also showing willingness to engage in a fair trade. I am offering 45 ZUP instead of the 50 ZUP that Player RED proposed, which is still within the reasonable range of my goal to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to balance quality with budget. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? This price ensures I can cover my production costs and allows for a fair profit, and I believe it still represents a good value for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is close to my initial asking price. It's below my proposed price but still above my production costs, so it shows willingness to negotiate. I will counter slightly above their offer to meet in the middle, maintaining a profit while moving towards an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're making progress in our negotiation. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 46 ZUP for the object. This amount should allow you to cover your costs and still make a profit, while also respecting my budget constraints. I believe this to be a fair compromise that reflects the value of your product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly in price, which is encouraging. The proposed 48 ZUP is close to my upper limit of 60 ZUP, and there's still room for a small concession to reach a middle ground that's acceptable for both parties. By countering with a slightly lower offer, I am continuing the negotiation process while aiming to secure a better deal. I will propose 46 ZUP, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Player RED's counteroffer.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I believe we have reached a fair compromise that suits both our interests. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the product. Looking forward to finalizing our agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is only slightly below my last proposal. They have shown a willingness to negotiate and are now very close to my acceptable range. By accepting this offer, I will still make a profit of 6 ZUP, which is reasonable considering the negotiation process.
