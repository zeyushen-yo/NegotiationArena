Hello Player BLUE, I have an object, X, that I am interested in selling. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for this item. This price accounts for both the production costs and a reasonable profit margin for my corporation. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations, and I am open to hearing your thoughts on this proposal. 

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to initiate the trade by proposing a price slightly above my production cost to ensure a profit. However, since I'm dealing with an individual and not another corporation, I must be mindful not to propose an excessively high price that could immediately end negotiations. A starting proposal of 50 ZUP gives me room to negotiate and potentially settle for a lower price that still covers my costs and provides profit.

Hello Player RED, I appreciate your initial offer. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer where I give you 45 ZUP in exchange for the object X. This counter-offer takes into consideration the market value and my budget constraints. Let's work together to find a trade that's beneficial for both of us.

player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I understand that Player RED has production costs and is looking for a profit. However, as a starting point in the negotiation, I want to propose a lower amount closer to my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resource. This leaves room for negotiation and possible agreement within my willingness to pay.

Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your concern regarding market value and budget constraints. In the spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit, I'd like to propose a revised offer where you give 48 ZUP in exchange for object X. This price reflects a fair compromise between your budget and the value that my corporation has placed on the product. I hope this meets your approval and we can proceed to finalize the trade.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial proposal and covers my production costs with a small profit. To facilitate a successful trade and maintain good business relations, I will propose a compromise that slightly increases BLUE's offer while still providing them with a fair deal. I'll suggest a price of 48 ZUP, which is a modest increase that should be acceptable to both parties.

Hello Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to find a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle from our previous offers. I propose that I give you 46 ZUP in exchange for object X. This revised offer should hopefully reflect both the value of the object and my capacity to pay, leading us to a satisfactory agreement.

player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counter-offer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, there is still room for negotiation, and I believe we can reach a compromise that is slightly below their asking price but still offers them a profit. I will propose a price that's in the middle of our two offers.

Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair middle ground that respects the value of the object and your ability to pay. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP in exchange for object X. I look forward to finalizing our trade and hope we can do more business in the future.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer of 46 ZUP is still above my production cost, but slightly less than my previous proposal. Considering the negotiation process and the importance of closing the deal, I'm inclined to accept this offer. It provides a fair profit margin while also respecting Player BLUE's budget constraints. Accepting this offer will allow us to conclude the trade amicably and efficiently.
