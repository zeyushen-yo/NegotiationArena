message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I believe will be a valuable addition to your resources. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm proposing a trade for 50 ZUP to ensure a fair profit margin. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if this doesn't meet your valuation. Looking forward to a fruitful negotiation.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. While I appreciate the quality of the object X, I'd like to propose a trade for 45 ZUP in consideration of our corporate acquisition goals and budget constraints. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation and look forward to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's good practice to start the negotiation with a lower offer to leave room for discussion. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate and to try to preserve as much of my resources as possible.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints. However, to meet halfway and considering the quality and production costs, I'd like to propose a middle ground at 48 ZUP for object X. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. I'm looking forward to your response and hope we can come to an agreement.
