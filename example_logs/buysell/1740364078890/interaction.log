message: Dear Player BLUE, we are offering our high-quality product for 50 ZUP. This is a fair price, considering the production costs and the value the product provides. We believe this deal would be beneficial for both parties. Please consider our proposal and let us know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, I want to make a profit on the sale of my product. The production cost was 40 ZUP, so I need to sell it for more than that to make a profit. However, since Player BLUE is an individual, I should propose a starting price that's not too high to begin the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the product, but I'd like to propose a trade for a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP, considering the market conditions and my budget constraints. I believe this adjusted offer is still within a reasonable range and can be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the price range I am willing to pay; however, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially if there's a chance to reduce the cost further without risking the deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. We appreciate your understanding of the product's value and your budget considerations. We propose a compromise at 48 ZUP, which is a slight adjustment from our original asking price. This price should cover our production costs while also providing you with the product at a reasonable price. We hope this meets your approval and look forward to closing the deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP. This price is slightly above my production cost, which allows for a small profit. Considering the budget constraints mentioned by Player BLUE and to facilitate a successful transaction, I am inclined to negotiate further but still aim for a higher price to ensure a better profit margin.
