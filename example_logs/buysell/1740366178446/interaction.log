message: I have a high-quality resource available that I believe would greatly benefit your corporation. My asking price reflects the cost of production and the value it will add to your operations.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. Since the corporation might be willing to pay a premium for my unique resource, I'll start by asking for a higher amount. This leaves room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. I understand the need for a sustainable partnership. With that in mind, I'd like to propose a middle ground of 55 ZUP for the resource, which would allow me to cover production costs and contribute to a fair and beneficial partnership for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my production costs, but I'd like to make a profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount to come to a fair agreement that benefits both of us. By not reducing the price too much, I also maintain a strong negotiating position.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is still within the price range I am willing to pay. Nevertheless, it might be beneficial to negotiate further to see if we can reach an even more favorable price. A counteroffer slightly lower than 55 ZUP could potentially be accepted, as it would be closer to my initial counteroffer and still within my budget.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
