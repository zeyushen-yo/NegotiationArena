message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that a fair price for this transaction would be 50 ZUP, providing me a modest profit and ensuring quality for you. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my initial proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and also make a profit. However, I should not set the price too high as it might discourage Player BLUE from buying. I will propose a trade that asks for a moderate profit margin above my costs.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and understand the need for a profit on your end. However, I am looking to minimize costs while ensuring a fair trade for both parties. Would you consider selling your resource for 45 ZUP? This price would still offer you a profit and help us establish a potentially ongoing business relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is good practice to negotiate for a better deal if possible, especially since my goal allows me to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will attempt to secure a lower price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of cost-efficiency for your operations. In the spirit of compromise and to foster an ongoing relationship, would you agree to meet halfway at 47 ZUP? This ensures a fair profit for me while still providing you with a competitive purchase price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost. Accepting this offer would still allow me to make a profit, albeit a smaller one. However, I want to try and negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my return while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I will make a counterproposal that splits the difference between our two offers.

message: Player RED, I am pleased with your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us, ensuring you a profit and me a competitive purchase price. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the resource. Looking forward to future business together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 47 ZUP is within my acceptable range and closer to the initial offer I made. Accepting this offer would ensure a fair deal for both parties and could help in building a good relationship for future transactions. It is close to the middle ground between our initial offers, making it a reasonable compromise.
