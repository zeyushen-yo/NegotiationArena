player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I am a corporation, my main goal is to sell the product for a profit. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I need to sell it for more than that to make a profit. I will start by proposing a price slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.
