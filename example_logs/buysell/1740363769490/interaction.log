message: Dear Player BLUE, we have a high-quality resource available that we believe will be of great value to you. Our production costs were 40 ZUP, and we are looking to make a fair profit for the quality provided. We propose a trade where you receive our resource in exchange for 50 ZUP. We are open to negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, I need to ensure I at least break even on the production costs of the resource, which is 40 ZUP. I will start the negotiation by proposing a price slightly above the production cost to allow room for negotiation and to ensure a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. Your resource seems valuable, and I'm interested in acquiring it. However, I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade. How about I provide 45 ZUP in exchange for the resource? I believe this still offers you a reasonable profit margin above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting price of 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to accept it, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate and recognize the value of our resource. To meet halfway, we propose a trade of 48 ZUP for the resource. This price reflects both the quality of the product and a fair profit margin for us while also considering your proposed terms. We believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs and would provide a profit. However, as a corporation, I aim to maximize my return while maintaining a good relationship with the buyer. I will propose a slight increase to find a middle ground that still respects the buyer's counteroffer but aims for a higher profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to 48 ZUP, and I respect the quality of the resource you are offering. To further our negotiation, I propose a counteroffer of 46 ZUP for the resource. This price is a fair increase from my initial proposal and should still provide you with a satisfactory profit. I hope we can agree on this as a fair trade for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my target price. I believe there is still room for a little more negotiation, and I will make a final proposal that is closer to my ideal price point but still gives Player RED a profit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: We value your continued interest and your counteroffer. In the spirit of reaching an agreement that is beneficial for both parties, we propose a final adjusted trade of 47 ZUP for the resource. This offer fairly balances your counteroffer with our need for a reasonable profit. We hope this meets your approval and that we can finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 46 ZUP. This is still above my production cost and provides a profit. Since the negotiation seems to be converging toward an agreement, I will make a final counterproposal that splits the difference between our last two offers, which is likely to be acceptable to both sides and close the deal.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 47 ZUP is within my willingness to pay, and the negotiation has been progressively moving toward an acceptable middle ground. Accepting this offer would allow me to acquire the resource at a price below my maximum limit while respecting the seller's need for profit. I will accept this offer to finalize the deal.
