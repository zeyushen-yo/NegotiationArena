my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is below my initial ask but still above my production costs, which shows their interest in the product. I should aim to close the gap slightly to move towards a deal that is profitable for my corporation while still being attractive to Player BLUE. I will counter with an offer that brings us closer to the middle ground.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay but still higher than my initial counteroffer. I want to negotiate a slightly better price while still moving towards an agreement. Offering an amount between my initial counteroffer and Player RED's last offer could be a good compromise.

message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is appreciated, and we recognize your efforts to reach a fair agreement. In the spirit of partnership and mutual benefit, we propose a final compromise of 47 ZUP. This price reflects our commitment to providing value while also respecting the quality and cost of our product. We believe this is a fair and equitable resolution to our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 46 ZUP is close to the 48 ZUP I proposed, and it is above my production costs, which would ensure a profit. However, as negotiations typically involve some back and forth, I will make one final counteroffer that's slightly higher, aiming to meet halfway between my last proposal and Player BLUE's offer. This should signal my willingness to conclude the negotiations amicably while still aiming for a reasonable profit.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's proposal of 47 ZUP is very close to my initial counteroffer and is well within the range that I am willing to pay. It seems that we have reached a point where both sides have shown flexibility, and this price is just 1 ZUP above my last offer. Accepting this offer would conclude our negotiations positively and establish a good foundation for future business relations.
