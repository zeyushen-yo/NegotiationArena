message: I have a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell. Considering the production costs and the value of the product, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade where I can make a profit over my production costs, but also offer a reasonable price to Player BLUE. Therefore, I will ask for a bit more than what it costed me, leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to optimize my expenses. I propose a trade of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a competitive counteroffer that reflects my interest in the product while maintaining a fair price for both of us. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, and my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I would like to propose a slightly lower trade to leave room for negotiation. This way, I can try to get a better deal and save some ZUP.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your need to optimize expenses. I believe that we can both benefit from this deal. So, let's meet halfway between our initial offers. My new proposal is 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allows me to cover my costs while giving you a fair deal on the product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer closer to my production cost. I would like to still make a profit but also want to make the sale. I will propose a counteroffer between our initial proposals that still allows me some profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. To continue our good-faith negotiation, I'm willing to raise my offer to 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should help us find a mutually agreeable price that respects your production costs and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, which is a good sign. They have proposed 48 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there's still a little room to negotiate for a better price. I'll propose a slightly increased amount from my last offer, showing my willingness to compromise, but still aiming to conserve my resources as much as possible.
