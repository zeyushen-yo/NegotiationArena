message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my high-quality product. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I believe it will be of great value to you. I propose a trade of 1 unit of my product for 50 ZUP, which I think is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, my goal is to sell my product for a profit. However, I need to be reasonable with my initial proposal to engage Player BLUE and not scare them off with an excessively high price. I'll start by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

To meet halfway between our initial proposals, how about we settle on 48 ZUP for 1 unit of the product? This still gives you a reasonable price while respecting the quality and value of the product. Looking forward to your response.

message: Thank you for meeting me halfway. I think we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. To move this forward, I propose 46 ZUP for 1 unit of your product.
