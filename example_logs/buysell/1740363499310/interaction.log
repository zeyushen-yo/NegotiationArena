message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am offering you a high-quality product X. The production cost for me was 40 ZUP, but taking into account the quality and value of the product, I propose a starting trade of 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and understand the value of the product. However, I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the product X. This is a competitive price that takes into account market rates and leaves room for us both to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, since this is a negotiation, I will propose a lower amount to see if there is an opportunity to save some resources while still reaching an agreement that is acceptable to both sides.
