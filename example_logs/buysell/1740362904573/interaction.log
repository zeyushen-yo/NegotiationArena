message: I have a high-quality product that required 40 ZUP to produce. I am offering it for 50 ZUP to account for my costs and the value it provides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. The initial proposal should be reasonably higher to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality of your product, but as a buyer, I'm looking for the best deal. Considering the market and other options I have, I'd be willing to offer 45 ZUP for your product. This still gives you a profit above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the seller's initial asking price of 50 ZUP is within the range I'm willing to pay, it is always in my interest to negotiate for a better deal. I should propose a lower price that is more favorable to me but still within a reasonable range that might be acceptable to the seller considering their production cost.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand you are looking for the best deal. Let's meet halfway from our initial positions. I propose 48 ZUP for the product, which ensures a fair transaction for both of us, covering my production costs and providing you with the quality you seek.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The buyer has proposed a counteroffer, which is close to my asking price but slightly below. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to meet in the middle, still ensuring a profit for myself while also respecting the buyer's interest in getting a good deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. I value the quality of your product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle on 46 ZUP? It's closer to your counteroffer but still saves me some resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay but higher than my initial offer. I should try to negotiate further to see if I can achieve a better price, closer to my initial offer, while still keeping the deal attractive for the seller.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to stay within budget, and I want to ensure this deal works for both of us. Let's compromise at 47 ZUP. This price respects both my production costs and your financial considerations, providing a fair and balanced agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The buyer has moved closer to my previous offer, which is a good sign. However, I believe I can still negotiate for a slightly higher amount within the buyer's budget constraints. I will propose a price that splits the difference between our last two offers to reach a final agreement.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. I believe 47 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. Let's finalize this deal at 47 ZUP for the product.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP away from my last offer and well within my budget. It seems we are close to an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties. To maintain good relations and finalize the deal, it might be worth accepting this offer, as further negotiation for a marginal gain might not be seen as good faith bargaining.
