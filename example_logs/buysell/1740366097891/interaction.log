message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. I've invested 40 ZUP into its production and am looking for a fair price that reflects its value. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my resource X. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit above my production cost. I will propose a higher price initially, as I expect Player BLUE to negotiate and possibly counter with a lower offer.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer for the high-quality resource X. I recognize your investment and would like to propose a slightly adjusted offer of 45 ZUP for the resource. This price should provide you with a reasonable profit margin while being in line with market rates. I look forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP which is within my willingness to pay, however, it is always beneficial to attempt to negotiate a better deal, especially since this is the first proposal. I'll propose a slightly lower price that is still above their investment cost to see if they are willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to meet halfway. I propose a revised price of 48 ZUP for my resource X, which should be a win-win for both of us. This offer provides you with a quality resource while ensuring a reasonable return on my investment. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I would like to negotiate for a higher price to maximize profit. I will propose a price between my initial offer and their counteroffer to find a middle ground.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Your offer of 48 ZUP is quite reasonable, but I would like to propose a final adjustment to 47 ZUP. This price would reflect a fair compromise and still ensure a good return on your investment. I hope you find this offer acceptable and we can proceed with the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still below it. Since the price is reasonable and only 3 ZUP above my initial counteroffer, accepting this proposal could save time and effort in further negotiations, ensuring a quick acquisition of the resource. However, I may try to negotiate one more time for a slightly lower price to see if there is room for further compromise.

message: Player BLUE, I find your offer of 47 ZUP to be fair and a good compromise for both parties. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Thank you for the constructive negotiation, and I look forward to finalizing our agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 47 ZUP is close to my previous proposal and still allows for a decent profit. It's only 1 ZUP less than what I asked for, and coming to an agreement now would secure a sale. It's important to close the deal while the buyer is interested, so I will accept this offer.
