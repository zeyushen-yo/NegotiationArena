message: 
To initiate our trade, I propose providing you with one unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the costs of production and includes a reasonable profit margin for our corporation. We believe this offer is fair and hope to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I want to initiate the trade by proposing a deal that would cover my costs and include a profit margin. However, I need to be mindful of what Player BLUE may be willing to pay. I will propose a trade that asks for slightly more than my production costs to open the negotiation.
