message: I have a high-quality product that I'm sure you will find valuable. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, and I believe 50 ZUP is a fair price that reflects its value and the effort put into it. Let's make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to start by proposing a price slightly above the production cost to ensure a profit. However, I need to be cautious not to set the price too high as that may deter Player BLUE from accepting the trade. I will propose a trade at 50 ZUP to start the negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality and effort put into your product. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the item. I believe this is a competitive price that still respects the value of your work.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the seller has proposed a starting price of 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal by offering a lower amount. This will give me room to adjust my offer in the subsequent proposals if necessary.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a competitive price. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This price ensures you're getting value for your money, and it allows us to cover our costs and maintain the quality you expect.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which is acceptable. However, as a corporation, I aim to maximize profit while maintaining a good relationship for potential future transactions. Splitting the difference between my initial offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer could be a good strategy to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties. I will counter with a price of 48 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and closer to my initial asking price.

message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I'd like to propose a price of 46 ZUP. This price is a little closer to my initial offer and I believe it remains fair for both of us, considering the quality and value of your product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has made a compromise by lowering the price to 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will make one more attempt to get a better deal while staying reasonable and close to their counteroffer.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I propose we settle on 47 ZUP for the item. This price is a fair compromise and ensures that both parties are satisfied with the deal. I believe this reflects the quality of the product and our mutual respect for a fair trade. Let's finalize this deal and look forward to future business together.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 46 ZUP is still higher than my production cost, which keeps the deal profitable. Since this is my third proposal, I should aim to close the deal soon while still trying to achieve a higher sale price. I will make a final counteroffer that is slightly higher, at 47 ZUP, as a compromise between our last two proposals. This should reflect a willingness to negotiate and finalize the trade amicably.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP above my last offer and well within my budget. Since this price is reasonable and close to my target, I will accept this offer to close the deal efficiently and maintain a good relationship for potential future business.
