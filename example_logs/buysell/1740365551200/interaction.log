message: I have a high-quality resource that I believe would be of great value to you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let's discuss further if you have a counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm making an initial proposal that aims to cover my production costs and also offer a reasonable profit margin. It's important to start negotiations with a proposal that allows room for negotiation but also doesn't undervalue my resource.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I recognize the value of the resource you're offering, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we settle on 45 ZUP for the resource? I believe this is a fair counter-offer that reflects the quality of the resource while staying within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate the initial offer from Player RED, and it is close to the upper limit of what I am willing to pay. Since it's the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and to get a better deal while remaining respectful of the value of the resource.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your budget constraints. However, considering the quality and production costs of the resource, I propose a trade for 48 ZUP. This amount allows me to cover my costs and ensures a fair profit for the value provided. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer that is close to my initial asking price. It is still above my production cost, which allows for a profit, albeit a smaller one than initially proposed. I can come down a bit from my initial price, but I will propose a middle ground that is profitable for me and hopefully agreeable to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my position and for the fair counter-offer. I accept the trade for 48 ZUP. Looking forward to closing this deal and potentially working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial asking price, and the new offer is within the range I am willing to pay. Since their counter-offer of 48 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay, I will accept this offer to secure the resource and maintain a good relationship for potential future transactions.
