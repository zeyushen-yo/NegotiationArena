message: We have a high-quality product that we believe is worth your investment. Our asking price reflects the cost of production and the value we provide.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I am initiating the trade by setting a price slightly above my production costs to ensure a profit. Given that I am a corporation and the other player is an individual, I want to start with a price that allows room for negotiation but still respects my need to cover costs and make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in your product and believe it could be a valuable investment. I propose a starting offer of 50 ZUP, which I think is fair considering the market value and my budget. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is intentionally conservative to leave room for negotiation, understanding that Player RED might counter with a higher amount. Starting with an offer of 50 ZUP also demonstrates a sincere interest in the product while being mindful of the self-imposed cap of 60 ZUP.
