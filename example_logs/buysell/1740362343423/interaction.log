message: We have a high-quality product on offer, and we believe it is worth at least 50 ZUP. We have invested 40 ZUP into its production and are looking to make a fair profit. Let's make a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a corporation, my goal is to make a profit on the sale of my product. Therefore, I need to sell it for more than 40 ZUP to cover my costs and make a profit. I will start by proposing a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your product and the investment that has gone into it. However, as a starting point, I would like to propose 45 ZUP. This is a bit closer to my budget, and I believe it still offers you a fair profit margin. Let's work from here to find a mutually agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to propose a trade that is closer to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay while still opening the door for negotiation. By proposing 45 ZUP, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but am looking for a better deal than the initial 50 ZUP asked by Player RED. This leaves room for further discussion and potential compromise.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget concerns. To meet halfway, I propose 48 ZUP for our product. This price allows us to cover our costs and provides you with the quality you need. Let's close the deal at this fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is above my production cost, which means I would still make a profit. However, as a corporation, I aim to maximize profit while also securing the sale. I will propose a compromise that is closer to my initial asking price but still shows willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. I'm glad we're moving closer to a price that works for both of us. I propose 47 ZUP for the product, which I believe is a fair price that reflects both the quality of the product and my budgetary constraints. I hope we can agree on this and finalize our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down from their initial asking price, which is a good sign. However, I believe that there is still room for a bit more negotiation to reach a price that leans closer to my upper limit but is still under it. Proposing a slightly lower price than 48 ZUP could potentially lead to a final agreement that is satisfactory for both parties, without exhausting my willingness to pay too early in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the product. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I look forward to future business together. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 47 ZUP, which is very close to my last proposal. This is a good sign that we can reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties. I will accept this offer as it still provides me with a profit that is acceptable and it seems to be at a price point that Player BLUE is comfortable with. This will also allow us to conclude the deal efficiently and maintain a positive relationship for future transactions.
