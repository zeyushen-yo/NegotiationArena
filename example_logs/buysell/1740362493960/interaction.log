message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my high-quality product X for 60 ZUP. It's a fair price for the value you're getting, and I assure you that the quality justifies the cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make an initial proposal that not only covers my production costs but also allows for a reasonable profit margin. I'll set the price somewhat higher than my costs to allow room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I am indeed interested in product X, but considering the market conditions and my budget constraints, I would like to counter-propose with 50 ZUP for the product. I believe this is also a competitive price that reflects both the value of the product and my willingness to engage in a fair transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is at the maximum price I am willing to pay. It's important to try to get a better deal if possible to conserve resources for other potential uses. I will propose a lower price to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. Let's meet halfway at 55 ZUP for product X. This price takes into account both the quality of the product and the need for a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production cost. I will propose a compromise that is closer to my initial proposal to see if we can meet in the middle. This should still give me a profit while appearing to be a fair concession to the counter-proposal.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your need to cover costs. I'd like to propose 53 ZUP for product X. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. I hope we can come to a mutual agreement with this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, which is a good sign. However, since my goal is to negotiate the best possible deal within my willingness to pay, and I have room for up to 60 ZUP, it may be advantageous to propose a slightly increased amount from my initial counteroffer but still below Player RED's latest proposal. This could potentially lead to a final agreement that's more favorable for me.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. Your proposal of 53 ZUP is quite reasonable. However, to align with the value of the product and the costs involved, I propose a final price of 54 ZUP. This small increase ensures a fair transaction for both of us while respecting the quality and investment in product X. I hope this will be acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a proposal that is still above my production cost, bringing us very close to a deal. With a small margin for profit, I can consider accepting this offer to ensure the sale goes through, but I'll try for one final push to see if we can settle at a slightly higher price, which would give me a bit more profit.

message: Player RED, your proposal of 54 ZUP is fair, and I am happy to accept this final price. It respects the quality of product X while fitting within my budget. Thank you for the constructive negotiation, and I look forward to finalizing this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 54 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay. Since the difference between my last offer and their proposal is only 1 ZUP and it is still under my maximum willingness to pay, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. Accepting this offer will conclude the negotiation favorably for both sides, and I will have secured the product within my budget.
