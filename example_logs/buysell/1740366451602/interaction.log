message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe will be a valuable asset to your operations. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP, which I think is a fair price considering the quality and the costs involved in producing it. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering the object at a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I'll propose a price slightly higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. We are definitely interested in the object you have. However, as a standard procedure, we conduct an initial assessment to ensure we're getting the best value. Would you be willing to consider a price of 45 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 50 ZUP for the object is within the range that I am willing to pay, but as a corporation, it is standard practice to negotiate for a better deal if possible. Thus, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your interest, Player BLUE. I appreciate your proposal and understand the need for a fair assessment. To meet in the middle, I'd be willing to adjust the price to 48 ZUP. This is a competitive offer that reflects the value and the production cost of the object. I hope this revised proposal aligns with your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to counter with a price that meets halfway between my initial offer and their counteroffer, which would allow me to secure a profit and potentially close the deal.

message: Player RED, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. We are close to an agreement. To finalize our deal, I would like to propose a price of 46 ZUP. This offer takes into consideration the value you've described and also aligns with our internal assessment. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a fair compromise between our initial proposals. However, I may try to negotiate a bit further for a better price, given that we have room for negotiation and I have not yet reached my proposal limit.
