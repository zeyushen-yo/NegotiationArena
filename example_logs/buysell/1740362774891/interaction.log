message: Dear Player BLUE, we are offering our high-quality resource X for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the costs of production as well as a reasonable profit margin for our corporation. We believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, my objective is to sell the product for more than it cost to produce, which was 40 ZUP. I want to start the bidding at a higher price to leave room for negotiation, so I will propose a price that gives me a profit margin while still being reasonable for an opening offer.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for a fair price that covers production costs and profit margins. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this price still provides a good value for both of us, considering the market conditions and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but I will attempt to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept or counter-offer.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. We appreciate your consideration of the market conditions and our need for a fair profit. We believe that a slight increase to 47 ZUP would be a mutually beneficial agreement, ensuring value for you and a modest profit for our corporation. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and would still yield a profit. While I could accept this offer to ensure a quick sale, I would like to counter with a slightly higher price to maximize profit, while still remaining attractive to Player BLUE. I'm considering a compromise that is closer to my initial asking price but still gives Player BLUE a sense of negotiation success.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair price for both parties. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is very close to my initial counteroffer, and it is still below the maximum amount I am willing to pay. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the resource at a reasonable price and conclude the negotiation successfully.
