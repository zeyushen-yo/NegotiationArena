Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in your product, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to account for my budget constraints. Let me know if this is acceptable or if there's a counter-offer you would like to make.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price is 50 ZUP which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, in negotiation, it's common practice to propose a counter-offer lower than the initial asking price to find a middle ground that could be more favorable for me.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost. I want to maintain a profit margin, but I also want to make the sale. I will counter with a price that is still above my production costs and hopefully acceptable to both parties.
