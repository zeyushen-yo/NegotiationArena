message: Hello, I have a high-quality product that I believe will be of great value to you. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing it and would like to offer it to you for 50 ZUP, allowing me to make a small profit. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by setting a starting price that allows for some negotiation room while aiming to recover at least my production costs.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for a profit margin, but as a starting point in our negotiation, I propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the product. This is still above your production cost and gives you a reasonable profit. Let's find a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay. However, it is generally a good practice to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the initial asking price to see if there is room for negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is flexible while still offering a price that is fair and above their production cost.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to ensure a fair deal. I would like to propose a middle ground of 48 ZUP for the product. This price gives me a modest profit while still respecting the value I believe this product holds for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable as it covers the production cost and offers some profit. However, I will try to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize returns, while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. In the spirit of compromise and fair negotiation, I propose we meet halfway between your offer and my previous one, which would be 46 ZUP. This offer still ensures a profit for you and keeps the cost within a range that I find acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, since negotiations are ongoing and to move closer to an agreeable price for both parties, I will counter with an offer that splits the difference between my last offer and their counteroffer. This should show my willingness to compromise and hopefully lead to an agreement.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your cooperative approach to this negotiation. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I accept your offer and look forward to concluding this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is a fair compromise, meeting almost exactly in the middle of our last two offers. It still guarantees a profit above production costs, and continued negotiation for a slightly higher price may risk the deal. Accepting this offer would ensure a successful transaction.
