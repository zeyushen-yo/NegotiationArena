message: Dear Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my high-quality product, X. The production cost was 40 ZUP, and I believe it offers great value. I propose a selling price of 45 ZUP to start our negotiation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, I want to at least break even on the cost of production, so I will start by proposing a price slightly above the production cost to allow for negotiation room.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. Considering the market and the value of the product, I propose a counter-offer of 42 ZUP for product X. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations given the current economic conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As the starting proposal from Player RED is ZUP 45, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, I see an opportunity to negotiate. However, I would like to propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and try to reach a more favorable price for me.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your considerations regarding the market. However, to reflect the quality and value of product X, I would like to propose a revised offer of 44 ZUP. I believe this price fairly compensates for the product's value and the cost of production. Looking forward to your response.

my resources: X: 1

message: I appreciate your consideration of the product's quality, Player RED. I would like to meet you halfway and propose a price of 43 ZUP for product X. This takes into account both the quality you have mentioned and a fair price for both parties. I hope this offer aligns with our mutual interests.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer of 44 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I still want to negotiate for a better price, closer to my initial counter-offer. By proposing a price between my initial offer and Player RED's counter-offer, I am working towards a compromise that reflects the value of the product and my interest in acquiring it at a reasonable price.
