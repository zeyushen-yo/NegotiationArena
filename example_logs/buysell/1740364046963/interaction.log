message: I understand the quality and costs associated with your product, but as a starting point for our negotiation, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource. I believe this leaves room for us to find an agreeable price that respects both your production costs and my purchasing power.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a lower offer than what Player RED initially asked for because it's the beginning of the negotiation, and I want to leave room for further negotiation. My maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, so starting at 45 ZUP gives me some flexibility.

message: Thank you for the consideration. I am willing to raise my offer to 46 ZUP in the interest of reaching a fair agreement that reflects both the quality of the product and the value of continued business. I believe this is a competitive offer that acknowledges your production costs as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, which is a good sign. They proposed 47 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, but I still believe there is room for a slightly better deal. I will counter with 46 ZUP, which is closer to my initial offer while still showing that I am willing to negotiate and respect their costs.
