message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I am looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I am open to hear your offers for it.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I cannot propose a new trade due to the rules and my proposal limit being 0, my only options are to wait for Player BLUE to propose a trade, and then decide whether to accept or reject it.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that the production cost of object X was 40 ZUP. I would like to propose a fair trade where I offer you 55 ZUP for the object, ensuring a profit margin for your production while staying within my budget. Let me know if this offer works for you or if you have a counter-proposal in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the player RED has informed me that the cost to produce the object X was 40 ZUP, I'd like to propose a fair price that gives them a profit but still remains within my willingness to pay, which is at most 60 ZUP. I am aware that I am only allowed to propose once and after that, I can only accept or reject. Therefore, I will propose a price slightly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, leaving some room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for object X. Thank you for a fair trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 55 ZUP, which is above my production cost and provides a profit. Accepting this offer meets my goal of selling the resource for more than it cost to produce. Since I am not allowed to propose any trades due to the rules, accepting this offer is the only viable option to successfully complete the transaction.
