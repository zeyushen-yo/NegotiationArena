message: Hello Player BLUE, we have a high-quality product X available for you. We are looking for a fair trade that benefits both parties. We propose a starting price of 50 ZUP, considering the costs and the value it brings to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, we aim to at least cover our production costs while making a profit. However, we should start by proposing a price slightly higher than our production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the product X. I believe this price is also fair considering the market and the value I expect from the product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting price proposed by Player RED is within the acceptable range of what I am willing to pay for the product. However, as with any negotiation, there is a need to attempt to secure a more favorable deal. Thus, I will counter with a slightly lower offer to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. We understand your position and the need for a fair market price. To meet halfway, we propose a slight increase to 47 ZUP for product X. This price ensures quality and value for your investment and helps us maintain sustainable business practices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above our production cost. This price is close to our initial proposal and would allow us to cover costs and make a small profit. To encourage a successful trade and maintain good relations for potential future business, it might be wise to consider accepting this offer. However, to negotiate further, we could propose a price in the middle to see if we can reach a slightly higher agreement.

message: I agree to the revised offer of 47 ZUP for product X. It's a fair price, and I'm pleased with the value it represents. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is close to the initial price they proposed and still within the range I am willing to pay. Since the counteroffer is reasonable and only 2 ZUP above my initial proposal, it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate in good faith. I will accept this offer as it's a fair price and secures the product for me without extending the negotiation process unnecessarily.
