message: I have a high-quality resource available, which I believe will add significant value to your operations. The production cost for this resource was 40 ZUP, but I'm offering it for a fair price of 50 ZUP, considering its value and potential. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the resource, which is 40 ZUP. I'll start by proposing a slightly higher trade to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the resource you've mentioned. Considering my budget and the value you've placed on your product, would you consider a price of 55 ZUP for the resource? This seems like a fair middle ground between your production cost and my maximum willingness to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that Player RED has production costs and is looking for a profit, but I would like to propose a trade closer to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Starting with a lower offer gives me some room to negotiate and potentially meet in the middle, respecting both my budget and the seller's profit margin.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I am pleased to accept the price of 55 ZUP for the resource. I'm looking forward to finalizing this deal with you and potentially continuing our business relationship in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 55 ZUP, which is above my production cost and is actually more than my initial asking price. It's a favorable deal for me, and I'm inclined to accept it to ensure a successful sale and a satisfied customer, which could lead to future business.
