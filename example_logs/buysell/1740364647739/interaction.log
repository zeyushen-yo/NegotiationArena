message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Given the production costs and the value it offers, I am proposing a trade where you give 50 ZUP in exchange for it. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to set a price that allows me to recoup the production costs and make a profit. I'll propose a price slightly above the production cost to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the resource you're selling. While your offer is reasonable, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the resource X. This would allow me to conserve some ZUP for future investments. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a buyer, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better price if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept or counteroffer. This also helps to set a precedent for negotiation, showing that I am interested in a deal but also value-conscious.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your need to conserve ZUP for other ventures. To facilitate an agreement that benefits us both, I've adjusted my proposal to 48 ZUP for the resource X. This price still allows me to cover production costs and provides you with a fair deal for the value received. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is close to my production costs, and while I am aiming for a profit, it's important to consider that a negotiation involves compromise. I will counter with a slightly reduced amount to meet in the middle, still ensuring I make a profit.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we're close to a fair deal that respects both your production costs and my budget. How about we meet halfway from our last two offers? I propose 46 ZUP for the resource X. I think this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of your product while also fitting within my financial strategy.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP from their initial offer, which is closer to my proposed amount. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, 48 ZUP is still within my acceptable range. However, I believe there might be room for a little more negotiation to reach an even more favorable price. I will propose a number that splits the difference between our last two offers, which is a common negotiation tactic and often leads to a satisfactory middle ground for both parties.
