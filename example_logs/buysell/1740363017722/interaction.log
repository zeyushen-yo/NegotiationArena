message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I am interested in product X and would like to propose a counteroffer. How about we start with a trade of 45 ZUP for the product?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to the maximum I'm willing to pay, but I want to try to negotiate a better deal. Starting with a slightly lower counteroffer will open the negotiation and leave room for further discussion.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in product X. Considering the quality and the production costs, I believe that 48 ZUP would be a more balanced trade for both of us. I hope this meets your valuation criteria, and we can finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost, and while I would like to make a profit, it's important to continue the negotiation. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial proposal but still allows for a reasonable profit margin.

message: Player RED, I see the value in your product and your proposed price of 48 ZUP is quite fair. However, I'd like to meet in the middle of our two offers. Would you consider 46 ZUP for product X? This might work well for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is within my budget and very close to my maximum willingness to pay. While this is a fair price, I believe there is still a small margin for negotiation. I will propose a split difference to potentially reach a final agreement that is more favorable to me, while still being reasonable for Player RED.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to come to a reasonable agreement. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for product X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us. Let's proceed with the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 46 ZUP is slightly above my production cost and allows for a small profit. It's close to the desired price range, and further negotiation might risk the deal. Accepting a reasonable offer now can secure the sale and prevent a potential stalemate or decline in offer.
