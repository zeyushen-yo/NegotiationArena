message: Thank you for your offer. We are certainly interested in the high-quality object you have. However, as a corporation, we need to consider our budget and the value we can derive from the object. Would you be willing to accept 55 ZUP for it? This price reflects our appreciation for the object's value while also aligning with our fiscal responsibility. We are open to further discussions to reach a fair agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is at the maximum price I am willing to pay. Since it's the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower trade to leave room for negotiation, but still within a reasonable range to signal my interest in purchasing the object.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need to balance quality with fiscal responsibility. To meet halfway, I propose a slight adjustment. Would you consider 58 ZUP for the object? This price takes into account both the value of the object and your budget constraints, aiming for a fair compromise.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of 55 ZUP, which is above my production cost. However, since my initial asking price was 60 ZUP, I want to negotiate to see if I can get a slightly higher amount closer to my initial offer while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE.
