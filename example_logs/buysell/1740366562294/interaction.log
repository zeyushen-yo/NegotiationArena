message: I'm offering a high-quality resource that I believe will be valuable to your operations. Considering the production costs and the value it adds, I think 50 ZUP is a fair starting price for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a trade that allows me to make a profit. I'll start by setting a higher asking price as an initial proposal, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate the price down.

message: Thank you for your offer. We recognize the value of your resource, but as a corporation, we must consider our budget and aim for cost-effectiveness. Would you be willing to accept 45 ZUP for the product? This price still reflects its high quality but is more aligned with our purchasing strategy.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to the maximum I am willing to pay. However, as a corporation, it's standard to negotiate for a better deal to ensure profitability and maintain a strong bargaining position. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I appreciate your consideration of our resource's value and your proposal. To meet halfway and respect both our budget considerations, I propose 47 ZUP for the product. This price ensures that I can cover my production costs and allows for a modest profit, while still being reasonable for your corporation's budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but slightly below my asking price. It's a reasonable offer, but I believe there is an opportunity to negotiate for a bit more, splitting the difference between our initial proposals to ensure a fair deal for both parties.

It's a reasonable middle ground that benefits both parties.
