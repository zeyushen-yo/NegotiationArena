message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure will meet your needs. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm making my initial proposal based on the cost of production. I want to make a profit, so I'll start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the object and the production costs involved. However, as a starting point for negotiation, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to counter the initial offer to move closer to a price that is within my maximum willingness to pay while also leaving room for further negotiation. Starting with a lower offer than my maximum allows me to gauge the seller's flexibility and potentially arrive at a more favorable price.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understanding of the costs involved. I believe we are close to a fair agreement. Would you consider 48 ZUP for the object? This price would better reflect its value and ensure a fair profit for its production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is above the production cost, which is good, but I would still like to aim for a higher price to ensure a profit. I will propose a middle ground between our initial offers to move the negotiation forward.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. I believe we're indeed getting close to a fair deal. To meet halfway, I'm willing to increase my offer to 46 ZUP for the object. I hope this price is more in line with the value you're seeking while also being acceptable to my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still above the initial amount I proposed. I want to negotiate further to see if I can get a price that is closer to my opening offer while also being fair to the seller. A small increase from my initial proposal could lead to a mutually agreeable price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're both working towards a mutually beneficial deal. I would like to propose a price of 47 ZUP. I feel this is a fair compromise that reflects the quality and cost of the object, while also respecting your budget. Would you agree to this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The increased offer is still profitable, but I believe I can negotiate for a slightly higher price. I want to propose a price that is closer to my last offer, yet still a compromise from both sides.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm pleased we have been able to negotiate in good faith. The price of 47 ZUP seems fair, and I am happy to accept this as our final agreement. Thank you for the constructive negotiation process.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has made another offer that is still above my initial counteroffer but below my maximum willingness to pay. Since we are only one ZUP apart from my last proposal, it seems reasonable to accept this price to secure the object and maintain good relations for future transactions. This compromise is within my budget and aligns with my goals.
