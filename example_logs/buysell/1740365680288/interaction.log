message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource available for sale. Considering the production costs, I am offering it for 40 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that ensures I at least break even on my costs. Since I am dealing with a corporation, they may have more resources, so I might be able to negotiate a higher price, but starting with a fair proposal gives us a starting point for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer for the high-quality resource X at 40 ZUP. To align with our budget and considering the market conditions, I would like to counterpropose with 35 ZUP for the resource. I hope we can find a mutual agreement that benefits both of us. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered the resource X for 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a corporation, it's in my interest to negotiate the best possible deal to maintain a strong bottom line. I will counter with a slightly lower offer to see if there is room for negotiation, while still offering a price that is reasonable and ensures profitability for both parties.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 35 ZUP, Player BLUE. However, that price would not cover my production costs. In consideration of both our positions, I'd like to propose a slightly higher price of 45 ZUP for resource X. This would allow me to cover costs and maintain a sustainable business. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which would result in a loss for me. I want to counter with a price that is above my production cost, but still reasonable enough to potentially be accepted by Player BLUE. I'll aim for a small profit margin while remaining open for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your response, Player RED. I understand the importance of covering production costs and maintaining a sustainable business. I propose a compromise at 40 ZUP for the resource X, which is the midpoint between our offers. I believe this is a fair price that respects both our positions. Please let me know if this is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's higher than my initial counteroffer. To reach a middle ground and secure the resource while also considering Player RED's production costs, I will propose a price that is between our two offers, still ensuring a good deal for my corporation.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your understanding and willingness to meet in the middle. Your proposal of 40 ZUP for resource X is acceptable to me, and I agree to this trade. Thank you for the fair negotiation, and I look forward to doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that meets my break-even point. Accepting this offer would ensure that I recover my production costs. It's a fair compromise, and holding out for a higher price could risk the deal, especially since the offer is in line with my initial asking price. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this proposal.
