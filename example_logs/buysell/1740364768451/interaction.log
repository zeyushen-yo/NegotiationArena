message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your costs and the need for a profit margin. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the product. This price is closer to my budget while still providing you with a profit over your production costs. I believe this is a fair counteroffer considering the market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening proposal from Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for their product. According to my goals, I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP, so their offer is within my acceptable range. However, it is standard practice in negotiations to counteroffer with a lower amount to find a more favorable agreement. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower trade in hopes of saving some resources while still making an attractive offer to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. We understand your budget concerns and appreciate your willingness to provide a profit over our production costs. We propose meeting halfway at 47 ZUP for the product, which we believe is a mutually beneficial price point. This offer takes into account both our need for a profit and your budget requirements.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE, which is above my production costs. However, as a corporation, I want to maximize profit while still making the deal appealing to Player BLUE. I will propose a price that splits the difference between our initial offers.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway at 47 ZUP. This seems like a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I accept your offer, and I'm ready to proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 47 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range but closer to their initial proposal. Since the proposed price is under my maximum willingness to pay and represents a compromise between the initial offers, it would be reasonable to accept this offer. It allows me to secure the product without exceeding my budget and also respects the seller's need for profit.
