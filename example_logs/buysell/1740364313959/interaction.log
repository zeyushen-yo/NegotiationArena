message: I appreciate the offer and I'm excited about the quality of the object. I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for it. I believe this still offers you a fair price considering the market and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resource.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for a fair deal for both parties. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? This price reflects the object's value and my costs while still providing you with a reasonable price. I believe this is a balanced offer that benefits us both.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my production cost, which doesn't leave much room for profit. However, I want to make the sale and maintain good relations for potential future business. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to meet in the middle.

message: Your adjusted offer of 48 ZUP is appreciated and I understand the need to cover your costs. I'm willing to come up a little bit more from my initial counteroffer. How does 46 ZUP sound? It's a bit closer to your last proposal and I believe it still represents a fair deal for both of us.

reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is still within my acceptable range and is closer to the initial asking price.
