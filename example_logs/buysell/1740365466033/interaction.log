message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I propose a trade where you give me 60 ZUP in exchange for X: 1. I believe this is a fair offer given the quality of the resource. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. However, I should start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the quality of the resource you're providing. However, in order to align with our corporate procurement policies and ensure a fair deal for both parties, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the trade terms. How about we settle on 55 ZUP for X: 1? This revised offer takes into account market conditions and the value we place on long-term partnerships.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade that is exactly at the maximum price I am willing to pay. However, as a corporation, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better deal if possible to maximize profit and resource efficiency. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to hear that you acknowledge the quality of the resource. In the spirit of reaching a fair agreement and fostering a long-term partnership, I'd like to propose a slight increase to 58 ZUP for X: 1. I believe this revised offer still provides excellent value for you while respecting the investment I've made into the resource. I hope you find this to be a reasonable middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 55 ZUP, which is above my production cost, so it's a profitable deal. However, it's also part of the negotiation to counter again to aim for a higher profit while still keeping the offer attractive to Player BLUE. I'll propose a small increase from their offer, which should still be acceptable to them while improving my profit margin.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Your counteroffer is quite reasonable, and I can see we're getting closer to a deal that benefits us both. In the interest of fairness and in recognition of the quality you're offering, I'd like to propose a new figure: 56 ZUP for X: 1. This reflects our commitment to a mutually beneficial partnership while also adhering to our budgetary considerations. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within the range of what I am willing to pay, but it's higher than my initial counteroffer. I want to try for a better deal but also show that I am willing to move towards a middle ground. I will make another counterproposal slightly higher than my last but still below Player RED's current asking price.

message: I'm grateful for your thoughtful proposal, Player BLUE. It's clear we're both aiming for a fair and beneficial outcome. Taking into consideration your budget and our potential for a long-term relationship, I propose a compromise at 57 ZUP for X: 1. This offer is a testament to the value of our budding partnership and ensures that both of us come out ahead. I trust you'll find this to be a balanced and final proposal that meets both our interests.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer of 56 ZUP is still a profitable margin above my production cost. However, as negotiations are coming to a close, it might be beneficial to make one final counteroffer that is closer to their proposal but still above it to maximize my profit while also closing the deal amicably. This should be my last proposal to leave room for a final response if necessary.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 57 ZUP, which is just below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a good compromise and falls within my acceptable range. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a price that meets my goal, and it would also establish a positive relationship with Player RED, which could be beneficial for future dealings.
