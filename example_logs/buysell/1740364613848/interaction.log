my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: We appreciate your counteroffer. To meet halfway, we propose a price of 58 ZUP. This price reflects the quality of our product and ensures that we can continue to offer such products in the future. Let's close the deal at this mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is closer to my production cost. While I want to make a profit, I also need to make a sale. I will counter with a price that is higher than their offer but lower than my initial proposal, aiming to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me partway. In the spirit of compromise and finalizing our deal, I propose a price of 57 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price that respects the quality of your product and allows us to create a beneficial partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is very close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, it may be beneficial to attempt one more small reduction to save resources while still maintaining goodwill in the negotiation. I will propose 57 ZUP, which is just below their offer but still within a reasonable range to potentially be accepted.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

reason: Player BLUE has come up to a price that is close to my last proposal. Since my goal is to make a profit and the offer is significantly above my cost price, it makes sense to accept this offer to ensure the sale and establish a good relationship with the buyer for potential future transactions.
