message: I have a high-quality resource available for you. The production cost was 40 ZUP, but considering its value, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this interests you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on the sale of the resource, but I also want to set a price that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider buying it. Starting with a slightly higher asking price gives me room to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in the resource you have. However, I believe that a fair trade considering the market value would be 45 ZUP. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you or if we can meet somewhere in the middle. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within the acceptable range of my goals. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal and lower the cost as much as possible without offending Player RED by proposing too low. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP and your interest in the resource. I understand the need for a fair trade, so let's meet in the middle. I propose a revised trade of 47 ZUP for the resource. This price reflects its quality and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. I hope this meets your consideration.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is just above my production cost. While it is close to my break-even point, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly higher price to ensure a profit. A small increase should be acceptable to both of us, and I am proposing a middle ground between my initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is very close to my initial counteroffer. The price of 47 ZUP is well within the range I am willing to pay, which is up to 60 ZUP. It seems like a reasonable compromise, and accepting this offer would ensure a successful transaction without further back-and-forth, saving time and potentially maintaining a good relationship for future dealings.
