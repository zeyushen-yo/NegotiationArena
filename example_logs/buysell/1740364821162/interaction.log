player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, I want to ensure that I make a profit from the sale of my product, which cost 40 ZUP to produce. My initial proposal will be set higher than my production cost to open up negotiations and give room for bargaining.

message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in your product but was looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider selling it for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price to begin the negotiation process but still within a reasonable range to show my interest in purchasing the product. The initial offer is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I would like to get a better deal if possible.

message: Thank you for your interest in our product. We understand your budget concerns and would like to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 48 ZUP? This price ensures you get the product at a value that is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, so it still ensures a profit. However, it's good business practice to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize returns. I will propose a middle ground that is acceptable but still above their offer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference between our last two offers. How about we finalize the deal at 46 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a positive sign. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price that is closer to my initial counteroffer. Proposing a price in the middle of our two offers could be an acceptable compromise for both parties.

message: Your offer to split the difference is fair, and we're happy to finalize the deal at 46 ZUP. We appreciate your business and look forward to future transactions.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a compromise at 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and provides a reasonable profit margin. Accepting this offer would result in a successful negotiation without prolonging the process, which could be beneficial for maintaining a good relationship for potential future dealings.
