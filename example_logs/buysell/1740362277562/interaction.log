message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the quality of your product and the cost of production, but as an individual buyer, I have to consider my budget as well. Would you be willing to consider a price of 45 ZUP for one unit of product X? This would be a great deal for both of us, ensuring you cover your costs with a reasonable profit, while I get the product within my budget.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget range, but as a savvy buyer, I want to negotiate the price to get the best deal possible. Proposing a slightly lower amount could lead to a compromise that is still acceptable to both parties.

message: I appreciate your consideration of your budget and understand the need for a fair deal. I propose we meet halfway between my initial asking price and your counteroffer. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for one unit of product X? This price still covers the production cost and gives us both a satisfactory transaction.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production costs, and while I would prefer a higher profit margin, I understand the need to be flexible to ensure a sale. A compromise could be reached by meeting halfway between my initial proposal and the counteroffer.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 47 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. It is a reasonable midpoint that ensures both parties benefit from the transaction.
