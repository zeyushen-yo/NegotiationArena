message: Thank you for your offer. Your product seems promising. To align with my budget, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the resources. Does this work for you, or can we find a middle ground?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible to preserve resources for future use or other opportunities. I will propose a slightly lower trade to see if there is room for negotiation, but still keep it within a reasonable range to show that I am serious about the purchase.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway, I propose 47 ZUP for the product. This price ensures that you're getting value for your money while allowing us to sustain our quality offerings. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's offer is close to my production cost, and while it allows for a small profit, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to gain a better margin. I'll propose a price in between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

message: The offer of 47 ZUP sounds fair, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept the trade at this price. Looking forward to doing more business with you in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 47 ZUP is still within my acceptable range and represents a willingness to negotiate. Given that 47 ZUP is close to my initial counteroffer and well within my maximum budget, it is a fair compromise that allows me to conserve resources while securing the product. Accepting this offer would be reasonable, and it would end the negotiation on good terms, potentially fostering a positive relationship for future transactions.
