message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality product X that I believe you will find valuable. I'm offering it for 45 ZUP. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to sell my resource X for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a price slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the product. I want to leave room for negotiation, so I won't propose a price too high.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer for the high-quality product X. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for the product. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is within my acceptable range, but as a savvy buyer, I want to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I would need to make a slight profit to justify the sale. How about we meet halfway at 42 ZUP? This would cover my costs and allow me a small margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that meets my production cost. However, I would like to make some profit on this transaction. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if we can meet in the middle, ensuring that both of us feel the trade is fair.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. To move this forward, I'd be willing to go up to 41 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is still within my goal range, but since negotiations are ongoing and we are close to my initial counteroffer, I'll try to reach a slightly better agreement while still keeping the deal attractive for both sides.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I believe 41 ZUP is a fair compromise that benefits us both. I accept your proposal. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 41 ZUP, which is just above my production cost. While my initial goal was to sell for a higher profit margin, securing a sale with a small profit might be better than holding out and risking no sale at all. I will accept this offer to ensure that the transaction is completed and I recoup my costs with a slight profit.
