message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a valuable object ready for sale. Considering the production costs and the quality of the product, I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I would like to start with a proposal that allows me to recover my production costs and gain some profit. I will propose a price slightly higher than my production costs to open negotiations and to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I understand the value of your product, but as a corporation, we have to consider our budget and the return on investment. I propose a counteroffer where I give you 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer should still cover your production costs while ensuring a fair deal for us both. Please consider this and let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is close to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a corporation, it's important to negotiate for a better deal and leave some room for potential counteroffers. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of our respective positions. I would like to propose a middle ground where I give you 1 unit of X for 47 ZUP. This price would allow me to secure a modest profit while respecting your budget constraints. I hope this meets your approval and we can close the deal at this fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that covers my production costs but does not provide much profit. I want to negotiate for a higher price to ensure a better return on my investment. I will counter with a price that splits the difference between my initial ask and their offer, which should still be attractive to them while giving me a bit more profit.

message: Player RED, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Your proposed price of 47 ZUP is quite reasonable. However, to align the deal more closely with our corporate purchasing policies, I'd like to propose a final price of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would represent a true middle ground between our positions, and I believe it to be a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal and move forward with a successful partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but it's still above the initial counteroffer I made. It might be possible to negotiate an even better deal. However, considering that the proposed price is close to my maximum willingness to pay, it might not be worth risking the deal over a small difference. I will make a final proposal that's a compromise between our last two offers.

message: Player BLUE, I'm pleased with your final proposal of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I accept this offer, and I am looking forward to a successful partnership. Thank you for the constructive negotiations. Let's proceed with finalizing the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 46 ZUP is only 1 ZUP less than my last proposal and still allows for a reasonable profit. It seems to be a fair compromise, and further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or a breakdown in the deal. Accepting this offer would ensure a successful sale and a potential for future business with this corporation.
