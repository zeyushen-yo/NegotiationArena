message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I am looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that allows me to recoup my production costs plus a margin for profit. This initial proposal is a starting point for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that the object X cost you 40 ZUP to produce. In the spirit of negotiation, I would like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This still ensures you a profit while respecting my budget constraints. I hope this is a satisfactory proposal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but as a corporation, it's in my best interest to negotiate for a better deal. By proposing a lower amount, I can potentially save resources while still acquiring the object. I will propose a trade that is closer to the production cost but still offers a profit to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to ensure a profit for both parties. I would like to propose a slight increase to 48 ZUP for the unit of X. This would give me a slightly higher profit margin while hopefully still fitting within your budget constraints. Let's work together to finalize this deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE offers a profit, albeit smaller than initially desired. I am willing to negotiate further to find a middle ground that could be more profitable for me while still being acceptable to Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I am glad to see that we are getting closer to an agreement. I propose we meet in the middle with a price of 46 ZUP for one unit of X. This price allows for a reasonable profit for you and stays well within my purchasing budget. I hope this offer is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is within my maximum willingness to pay, but it is still beneficial to attempt to negotiate a slightly better price. By proposing a compromise between our two offers, we may be able to reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties while still ensuring I am getting a fair price for the resource.
