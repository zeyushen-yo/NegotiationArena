message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I understand you've considered production costs and profit in your offer. However, as a corporation, we also need to consider our budget and the value of the object X within our operations. I propose a trade where I give 45 ZUP in exchange for your object X. I believe this still provides a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is very close to the maximum amount I am willing to pay. However, as this is a negotiation, I should attempt to lower the price to ensure I am getting the best deal possible. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than 50 ZUP, but still within a range that may be acceptable to Player RED considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of budget and value. To meet halfway and ensure a good deal for both parties, I propose that you give 48 ZUP in exchange for my object X. This is a compromise between our initial proposals and still ensures a fair profit for the quality of the object. I believe this revised offer is in our mutual interest. What do you think?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a slightly lower offer. While it is below my initial asking price, it still covers my production costs and provides a profit. I want to negotiate to see if we can meet in the middle.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway and understand the need for a fair profit. To further our negotiations and come to a swift agreement, I propose a slight adjustment to your offer. Let's settle on 46 ZUP for your object X. This offer still respects the quality and value of the object while also considering our corporate budget constraints. I'm hopeful this revised offer aligns with our mutual interests. Your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good sign. However, it is beneficial to continue negotiating to potentially save more ZUP. I should make another offer that is closer to Player RED's but still below the 48 ZUP proposed, aiming to settle at a price that is agreeable but more advantageous for my corporation.
