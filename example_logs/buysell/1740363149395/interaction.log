message: I have a high-quality object that I believe would be of great value to you. I've invested 40 ZUP into its production, so I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP to ensure a fair trade for both of us. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering the object at a price that allows me to make a profit, considering the production cost. I will propose a price higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the effort you've put into creating your object, and I am interested in acquiring it. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to start our negotiations. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial asking price from Player RED is 50 ZUP, and my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation. I want to make a counteroffer that is reasonable and closer to the value I place on the object, while still showing my interest in purchasing it.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your desire for a fair deal. Let's meet halfway between my initial ask and your counteroffer. I propose 48 ZUP for the object. This price allows me to cover costs and secure a modest profit, while still providing you with a reasonable purchase price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my asking price and covers my production costs. However, I'd like to aim for a bit more profit while still keeping the negotiation going. I will counter with a slightly higher price to find a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach. I propose a counteroffer of 46 ZUP for the object. This price allows you to cover your costs and profit, and it is closer to my intended budget for the purchase. I believe this offer is in line with a fair and mutual beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 48 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range but not at the maximum I am willing to pay. I'll make another counteroffer that's slightly below the proposed price to move closer to a middle ground, while still preserving the opportunity for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. Your proposed price of 46 ZUP is fair and acceptable to me. It covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is acceptable as it covers production costs and allows for a profit. Since the negotiation is progressing smoothly and approaching my minimum acceptable price, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid prolonging the negotiation, which could lead to a risk of not selling at all.
