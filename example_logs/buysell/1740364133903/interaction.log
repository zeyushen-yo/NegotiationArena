proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the high-quality object, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for it. This is a fair price considering the market and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within my acceptable range of paying at most 60 ZUP for the object. However, as part of negotiation tactics, it's common to propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for a better deal, while also leaving space for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway between our initial proposals, how about we settle on 47 ZUP for the object? This price would ensure a fair deal for both of us, giving you value for your money while allowing me to cover costs and make a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production costs, which is a good starting point. However, I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase my profit margin while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object. I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED for 47 ZUP is still within my acceptable range. It is a reasonable middle ground between our initial proposals. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay and conclude the trade favorably for both parties.
