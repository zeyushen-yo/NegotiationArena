message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a quality product X for sale that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that reflects its value and my investment. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this product. I believe this is a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to set a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. However, I need to be slightly flexible to leave room for negotiation. I will start by proposing a trade at a higher amount than my production cost.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the quality of your product and understand the costs involved in its production. However, I would like to make a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price that allows for a fair exchange for both of us. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is above my preferred price range, but it's close enough to continue negotiations. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my intended price point while leaving room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway and proceed with this deal, how about we agree on 48 ZUP for the product? This price allows for a fair profit on my end while still providing you with a high-quality product at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and would still allow for a profit. However, I initially asked for 50 ZUP to open room for negotiation. I will make a counteroffer that meets halfway between my initial proposal and Player BLUE's counteroffer. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit margin.

message: Player RED, I value your effort to find a fair price, and I am glad we are converging on an agreement. I propose a revised offer of 46 ZUP for your product. This price is a little closer to my initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a competitive price that reflects the value of the product while respecting your cost of production. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. It is within the acceptable price range but still above my initial counteroffer. I will propose a slightly lower amount to find a middle ground that is agreeable to both parties, considering I want to save room for at most two more proposals.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiation and your revised offer of 46 ZUP. I find this to be a fair price that respects both the quality of the product and the investment put into its production. I accept your proposal, and I'm pleased to close this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a second counteroffer of 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and close to my last proposal. Since we are converging towards a deal, and to avoid protracting negotiations, I will accept this offer to finalize the trade. This will provide me with a profit of 6 ZUP, which is reasonable and allows for a successful transaction.
