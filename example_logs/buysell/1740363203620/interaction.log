message: We have a high-quality product that we believe would be a great fit for your needs. Our initial asking price is 50 ZUP, which we feel reflects the value and the investment we've put into it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a corporation, I want to make a profit on the sale of my product. However, I must also consider the willingness to pay from Player BLUE, the individual buyer. My initial proposal will be slightly higher than my cost to test the waters and leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP. This is a competitive offer that reflects my interest in a fair trade for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the asking price of 50 ZUP is within the range I am willing to pay, it's always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it is the initial offer. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and to see if the seller values quick sale over holding out for a higher price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. We appreciate your understanding of the value of our product. To meet halfway and ensure a beneficial deal for both of us, we would like to propose a revised price of 47 ZUP. We believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the quality and cost of our product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, indicating a willingness to engage in fair trade and a recognition of the product's value. I want to make a profit, and this offer is profitable, but I believe there is room to negotiate for a slightly higher price without risking the deal. I will counter with a small increase to aim for a higher profit while still keeping the offer appealing to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate the compromise at 47 ZUP. To move us closer to an agreement, I propose an adjusted price of 46 ZUP. This should allow us to finalize the deal promptly, while still respecting the value of your product and my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has made a counteroffer that is still within my willing-to-pay range, and their willingness to come down from the initial price shows a desire to make the sale. However, given that there's still room for negotiation and I want to get the best possible deal, I will propose splitting the difference further to maintain good bargaining practice.

message: Your adjusted offer of 46 ZUP is appreciated and accepted. We're pleased to finalize this deal with you, respecting both the value of our product and your budget. Thank you for your business, and we look forward to potential future transactions.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price of 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and very close to my last proposal. This offer is reasonable and allows for a modest profit. It's important to consider the potential for future business with this individual, and so securing the deal at this price point may be beneficial in the long term. Further negotiation may risk the deal or appear uncooperative.
