message: I have a high-quality resource that could be very beneficial for you. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I propose a fair trade where you give 50 ZUP in exchange for my resource. Let's work out a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As the first proposal, I aim to make a profit over the production cost of the resource. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of your resource and appreciate the offer. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource, considering the market conditions and my budget constraints. I believe this adjusted offer is still fair and reflects the value of your resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As the initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for their resource, it is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal if possible, especially when it's the beginning of the negotiation. I will counter-propose with a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for a better price.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. To meet halfway and close the deal, I propose 48 ZUP for the resource. This price accounts for the value and the production costs, ensuring a fair transaction for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above the production cost, which is still profitable. However, it is below the initial asking price. I will counter with a slightly reduced price to move closer to an agreement while still aiming for a reasonable profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my position. I believe we are very close to an agreement. Would you consider 47 ZUP for the resource? This price is a good compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. There might be a little room to negotiate down further, but it's getting close to a point where it may be better to accept to ensure the deal goes through. I will make one more counteroffer to see if I can secure the resource for a slightly better price, while still keeping the negotiation friendly and open.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
