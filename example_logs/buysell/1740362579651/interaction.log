player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the corporation, I want to make a profit on the product I am selling. Considering the production cost of 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a price that includes a profit margin, but also leaves room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer of 50 ZUP for your product. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. This would be a more comfortable investment for me while still ensuring that you make a sale.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP for the product. It seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiation. However, it is always good to aim for a better price if possible, so I will try to propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation. This could potentially save some of my resources while still acquiring the product.

Turn: 0
message: We appreciate your counteroffer and understand your need for a comfortable investment. We propose a revised price of 47 ZUP, which is a compromise that ensures value for you and a fair return for us. This price reflects the quality and the cost of bringing this product to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come back with a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still above my production cost of 40 ZUP, allowing for a profit. While I initially asked for 50 ZUP, I understand that negotiation is part of the process. I will counter with a price slightly higher to meet in the middle, which should be agreeable to both parties.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I find the revised price of 47 ZUP to be fair, and I am happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 47 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This offer is a fair compromise and close to my initial counteroffer of 45 ZUP. Accepting this offer would allow me to acquire the product at a price within my budget while also respecting the seller's valuation of their product. I believe accepting this offer would be a good decision since it meets my goal and saves negotiation time.
