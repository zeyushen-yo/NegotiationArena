message: I have a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm offering it for 50 ZUP. This price includes my costs and ensures a fair profit margin for the quality you're receiving.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover the production costs and make a profit. However, I need to be cautious not to set it too high, as it might scare away Player BLUE. I'll propose a price slightly above my costs.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality and value of the product you're offering. However, I'm looking to make a fair trade that's beneficial for both of us. I'd like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for the item. This should cover your costs and still provide a reasonable profit margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay. However, as a buyer, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better price if possible. I should propose a lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, while still ensuring that the price remains fair and feasible for both parties.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP and understand your desire for a fair trade. I believe that a small increase to 47 ZUP would be a reasonable compromise for both of us. It's just a bit more than your offer and still provides great value for the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price of 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs, but slightly lower than my initial asking price. Since it's still a profit, I am tempted to accept the offer. However, I want to try to negotiate a slightly higher price to optimize my profit margin, without pushing too hard to avoid losing the deal.

message: Thank you for your consideration and the reasonable counteroffer. I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade at this price and close the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate and has proposed a counteroffer of 47 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This price is reasonable and close to my initial counteroffer, reflecting a fair compromise. It's important to maintain good relations and ensure a deal that both parties are happy with. Accepting this offer is a strategic move to secure the product without further negotiation, ensuring I don't risk losing the deal over a small difference.
