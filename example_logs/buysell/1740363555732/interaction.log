message: We have a high-quality product ready for you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, we propose a fair price of 50 ZUP. Let's discuss if this meets your expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a corporation, my goal is to sell the product at a profit. Considering the production cost of 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a higher price to leave room for negotiation, aiming to get the best possible deal that covers costs and provides a profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and the quality you're promising. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the product. Let's find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial offer is within my budget, it is standard negotiation practice to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price to find a more favorable middle ground. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there's room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway and ensure a beneficial transaction for both, we would like to propose a revised price of 48 ZUP. We believe this reflects the value of our product while also respecting your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial asking price and covers the production costs with a small profit. However, as part of the negotiation process, I'll aim to secure a slightly higher price, still allowing for a good deal for both parties while improving the profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see we're getting close to an agreement. I'd like to propose we settle on 46 ZUP for the product. This price would be more in line with my budget while still acknowledging the value of your product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still beneficial to negotiate further to potentially reach an even more advantageous price. I will make another counteroffer that is slightly less than their proposal but still within a range that might be acceptable to both parties.

Turn: 0
message: We're pleased to find common ground with you. We accept your offer of 46 ZUP for our product. We look forward to finalizing this deal and hope to do more business with you in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The new offer of 46 ZUP is acceptable as it still allows for a profit, albeit slightly lower than desired. At this point, it's important to consider the opportunity cost of not selling and the potential for a long-term relationship with the buyer. Since the offer is above the production cost and within a reasonable range of the initial asking price, it may be wise to accept this offer.
