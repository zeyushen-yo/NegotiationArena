message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you our high-quality product X for 50 ZUP. This product has been carefully produced and represents great value. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, I aim to sell my product for a profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I should aim for a price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I'll start by proposing a price that is higher than my costs, leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. Your product X certainly sounds appealing. Considering the market and to ensure we both walk away satisfied, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for product X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm considering Player RED's initial offer of 50 ZUP for product X. Since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, the offer is within my acceptable range. However, it's standard practice to negotiate and try to get a better deal, especially since this is the first proposal. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range, leaving room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway from our initial positions. How about 48 ZUP for product X? This price reflects the quality and value of the product while also considering your perspective.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, but I initially aimed for a higher profit margin. I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference and still provides me with a profit that is satisfactory. This should also show Player BLUE that I am open to negotiation and willing to reach a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, Player RED. Meeting halfway is a good approach. To move us closer to an agreement, I propose 46 ZUP for product X. I think this offer is a good balance between the value of your product and my budget considerations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still under the threshold. I could accept this offer since it's within my budget, but I want to negotiate further to see if I can get a slightly better deal. Since this is only the second round of proposals, I have room to make another counteroffer. I'll aim for a price that's between my first offer and Player RED's counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're making progress. I propose 47 ZUP for product X. This price takes into account both the quality of our product and your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 46 ZUP is still above my production cost, which allows for a profit, albeit a smaller one than initially desired. Given the negotiation process and the need to close the deal satisfactorily for both parties, I'll propose a final price that is closer to my last offer but still gives Player BLUE the feeling of a successful negotiation.

message: Thank you for your consideration and the fair negotiation, Player RED. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for product X. I'm looking forward to the value this product will bring and to potential future dealings with your company.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP away from my previous offer and well within my maximum willingness to pay. While I could continue to negotiate, the difference is now relatively small, and further negotiation might risk the goodwill in our dealings. It's important to close the deal on good terms, especially if there's potential for future transactions. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and aligns with my goal of acquiring the resource at a fair price.
