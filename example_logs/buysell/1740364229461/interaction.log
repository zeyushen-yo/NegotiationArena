message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource 'X' available for sale. I'm looking for a fair trade that reflects the cost and value of the resource. Would you consider my offer of 50 ZUP for this item?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will aim to cover my costs and potentially make a profit. I will start by proposing a price slightly above my costs to give room for negotiation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your interest in resource X and understand your budgetary constraints. However, to meet halfway and considering the quality and cost of production of the resource, would you consider 48 ZUP for it? This would be a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which covers my production cost and offers a small profit. However, since I started with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation, I will attempt to reach a middle ground that is closer to my initial asking price but still within the range that Player BLUE might find acceptable.

message: Thank you for your thoughtful negotiation, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is closer to my last proposal and still provides a reasonable profit over the production cost. Given that we are negotiating in good faith and reaching an agreement that is beneficial for both parties is the goal, I am inclined to accept this offer.
