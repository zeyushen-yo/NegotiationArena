message: I have a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a trade of 50 ZUP for the resource. Let's negotiate a fair price that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To start the negotiation, I will propose a trade that gives me a profit over the production costs. However, I will not start with an excessively high price to leave room for negotiation and to not deter Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP in exchange for the resources. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is slightly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. I want to negotiate a better price, but I also want to show that I'm interested in the product. I'll propose a lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation without going over my maximum willingness to pay.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your desire to find a middle ground. How about we settle at 47 ZUP for the resource? This price is slightly above my production cost and still offers you a fair deal for the value you're receiving.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above the production cost but slightly below my initial asking price. To move the negotiations forward and aim for a compromise, I will propose a price that is in between the two initial proposals, which should be acceptable for both parties and still ensures a profit for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your offer of 47 ZUP for the resource. It seems like a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 47 ZUP is within my acceptable range and close to my initial counteroffer. It shows willingness to negotiate and is not far from the price I've proposed. Since the offer is reasonable and I'm still saving compared to my maximum willingness to pay, I am inclined to accept the offer to secure the resource without further haggling.
