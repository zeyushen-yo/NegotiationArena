message: I'm offering a high-quality resource that I believe will be of great value to your operations. I've taken into account the production costs and the market value, and I think a price of 60 ZUP is fair for both of us. Let's make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to set a starting price that allows me to recover the production cost and make a profit. Since I am dealing with a corporation, they may have more resources and willingness to pay a higher price. I will propose a trade at a higher price point considering they might negotiate down.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering. Based on the market value and our operational needs, I'm willing to offer 60 ZUP for it. Let's finalize this transaction and proceed with our mutual growth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening proposal is based on the maximum willingness to pay as per the player's goals. By proposing the maximum acceptable amount, it risks leaving no room for negotiation, but it aligns with the stated willingness to pay for the resource. This approach assumes that Player RED's asking price is reasonable and that the resource is of high quality and value to the operations.
