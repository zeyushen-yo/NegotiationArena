my resources: X: 1

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the quality of the object and your production costs. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to make the deal more favorable for my budget while still providing you a profit over your costs. Let's find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP for the object. However, as a strategic move and to ensure I get the best deal possible, I will make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range, considering the seller's cost of 40 ZUP. This leaves room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, Player RED. I can increase my offer to 46 ZUP, which should keep us both within a comfortable trading range. I believe this offer is fair, considering both the quality of the product and my budget constraints. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, since we are negotiating and I want to ensure the best possible price within my budget, I will make another counteroffer that's slightly higher than my last offer but still below Player RED's current asking price. This should signal my interest in the product while maintaining the negotiation process.
