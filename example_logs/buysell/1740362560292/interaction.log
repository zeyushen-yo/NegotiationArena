message: We are offering our high-quality resource X for a competitive price of 50 ZUP. Considering the quality and the cost of production, we believe this is a fair offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, my goal is to sell the resource for a profit, or at least break even on the production cost. I will start by proposing a price higher than my cost to see if the individual is willing to pay a premium for the resource.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and the quality of resource X. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to take into account the market conditions and my budget. I believe this adjusted offer still reflects the value of your product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range of what I am willing to pay; however, it is always good to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since I aim to pay less than the maximum I am willing to go, which is 60 ZUP. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is open to negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: We appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. In the spirit of reaching a fair deal for both parties, we propose a middle ground of 47 ZUP for resource X. This allows us to cover our costs and ensures you are getting the product at a value that reflects its quality and the current market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost. While it is below my initial asking price, it is still above the production cost, which means I would make a profit. However, I believe there is still some room for negotiation to reach a slightly higher price that benefits both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the consideration and for meeting me halfway. I agree to the proposed price of 47 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I accept the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial asking price, which shows a willingness to negotiate. The new offer of 47 ZUP is very close to my target price of 45 ZUP and is well within the maximum of 60 ZUP that I am willing to pay. This is a fair compromise, and accepting this offer would secure the resource at a reasonable price without further negotiations that could risk the deal.
