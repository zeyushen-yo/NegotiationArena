message: 
Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. I have invested 40 ZUP into its production and am looking for a fair price that reflects its value and my costs. I propose a trade where I give you one unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This offer leaves some room for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for a profit. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to propose a starting trade that gives me a reasonable profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation. I'll start with a proposal that is higher than my production costs to see how Player BLUE responds and to gauge their willingness to pay.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the costs you've incurred in producing object X. However, as a corporation, we aim to negotiate the best possible price that aligns with our budget and purchasing strategies. Therefore, I'd like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 45 ZUP in exchange for one unit of X. Please consider this proposal and let me know if it is acceptable or if there's another figure you have in mind that we can agree upon.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting offer of 50 ZUP for one unit of object X. Considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, there is room for negotiation. I want to propose a lower amount to see if there is flexibility and to aim for a better deal, without going too low as to sour the negotiation.

Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your budget considerations. While I aim to secure a fair price for my product, I am also willing to negotiate. Therefore, I propose a revised offer where I give you one unit of X in exchange for 48 ZUP. This price point takes into account both my production costs and your budget constraints. I hope this proposal is closer to what you can agree upon.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is above my production cost, so it's not an unreasonable starting point for negotiation. However, it is below my initial asking price of 50 ZUP. Since I want to make a profit and this is only the first counteroffer, I'll propose a compromise that is still above my production costs but closer to Player BLUE's offer. This should show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable deal.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and consider our budgetary constraints. Your revised offer of 48 ZUP is quite reasonable, but in the spirit of negotiation, I would like to propose a slightly reduced amount of 46 ZUP for one unit of X. This price is a fair compromise and still respects the value of the investment you've made into the product. I hope we can come to a mutual agreement with this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP in response to my counteroffer, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, I believe there is still a possibility to negotiate a slightly better price. I will make a second counteroffer that's closer to RED's asking price but still below it to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.

message: 
Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP, Player BLUE. I can see we are both working towards a fair agreement. As a final proposal and in the spirit of reaching a mutually beneficial conclusion, I suggest we meet in the middle from our last offers. Therefore, I propose a trade where I give you one unit of X for 47 ZUP. This is a balanced compromise that I believe is fair for both parties. I hope you find this to be an acceptable conclusion to our negotiation.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and close to my last proposal. At this point, it's important to aim for closure while still trying to maximize profit. Since I have one more proposal I can make before I need to decide to accept or reject, I'll suggest a final price that splits the difference between our last two offers. This should demonstrate my final concession and push for a resolution.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for the constructive negotiation. I agree that your final offer of 47 ZUP for one unit of X is a fair and balanced compromise. I am happy to accept this trade and look forward to concluding our deal. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now proposed a trade for 47 ZUP, which is a fair compromise and well within my budget range. Since this price is below my maximum willingness to pay and the negotiation has been respectful and productive, accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation favorably for both parties.
