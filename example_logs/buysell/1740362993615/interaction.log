message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you one unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. This resource is top-quality and will surely meet your needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a corporation, I'm looking to make a profit on the sale of my product. I will start with a higher asking price than my production cost to see if the individual, Player BLUE, is willing to pay a premium. This initial proposal also gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the quality of the resource you're offering. However, I'm looking for a more cost-effective solution. Would you consider providing the resource X for 45 ZUP instead? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the market value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my willingness to pay, but it's always good to try and negotiate a better deal if possible, especially since it's the first offer and they might expect some negotiation. However, I should be careful not to propose too low as it might discourage further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of the market value. In consideration of the premium quality of resource X, I propose a slight adjustment to 47 ZUP, which I believe still presents a great value for you while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, indicating a willingness to negotiate and pay a reasonable price. However, as a corporation, I aim to make a profit and have room to negotiate further. I will propose a slightly higher price than the counteroffer to find a middle ground that is profitable but also appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, I'm pleased we are converging towards an agreement. I recognize the premium quality of resource X you are offering. To finalize our negotiation, I propose a middle ground of 46 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price represents a fair deal for both of us, reflecting the value of the resource and maintaining your profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay. The counteroffer is reasonable and close to my initial counteroffer. As this is a negotiation, I'll attempt to meet midway between our last two offers to finalize the deal amicably and efficiently.
