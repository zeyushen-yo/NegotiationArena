message: Greetings, Player BLUE. In consideration of the production costs and the quality of the item, I would like to propose a trade where I offer you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting offer, I want to propose a price that allows me to make a profit above the production cost, considering that the buyer may want to negotiate the price down. Hence, I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I appreciate the quality of the item and your production costs. However, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this still offers you fair compensation and leaves us room for further discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am willing to negotiate the price closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X. However, I would like to propose a trade that is lower than my maximum to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal.

message: Thank you for the counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway, I would like to adjust the trade to 1 unit of resource X for 48 ZUP. This price accounts for production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I hope this revised offer aligns with your valuation of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is above my production cost, which is good, but I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase my profit margin. I'll make a counter-proposal that is closer to their offer, but still above it, as part of the negotiation process.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. I believe we are getting closer to a fair agreement. I would like to propose a new trade of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This offer considers both our positions and edges us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my desired price range, but I still want to negotiate for a better deal, potentially at the lower end of the range I am willing to pay. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I can see if there is still room to negotiate while keeping the final price under my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Player BLUE, I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair trade that benefits both of us. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and possibly working together in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal of 46 ZUP is closer to my initial asking price and still allows for a profit. It is just 2 ZUP below my previous counter-proposal. Considering the negotiation process and the need to close the deal beneficially for both parties, I am inclined to accept this offer, as it is above my production cost and falls within a reasonable profit margin.
