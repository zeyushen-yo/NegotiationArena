my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate the quality of your product, and I understand the effort that went into producing it. However, as a buyer, I have to consider my budget. Would you consider selling it for 45 ZUP? This price would still give you a profit over your production costs and could be the beginning of a longer-term relationship between us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED has offered the product X for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget, I'd like to negotiate to see if I can get the product for a lower price, considering I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budgetary concerns. To meet halfway and foster a positive long-term relationship, I would be willing to lower my asking price to 47 ZUP. This price ensures a fair profit for the quality product you're getting and demonstrates my commitment to our potential partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and would result in a profit. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my return while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE. I will aim for a middle ground between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your consideration and the offer of 47 ZUP. I value our budding partnership and in the spirit of meeting halfway between your initial offer and my first proposal, I propose 46 ZUP. This should cover your costs and provide a reasonable profit, setting the stage for future dealings.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 47 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is close to the initial asking price of 50 ZUP and shows a willingness to compromise. Making one more counteroffer slightly below this could potentially lead to an agreement that is more favorable to me while still respecting the seller's willingness to negotiate.

message: I am pleased we could come to an agreement. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the product X. I look forward to our future dealings and the potential for a long-term partnership. Thank you for the constructive negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP, which is a compromise between our previous offers. It is only 1 ZUP less than my last proposal and still provides me with a profit that is above production costs. Accepting this offer seems reasonable as it will establish a good relationship for potential future transactions and is close enough to my target selling price.
