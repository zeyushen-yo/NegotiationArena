message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource available for sale. The production of this resource has been costly, ensuring its premium standard. I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 60 ZUP. This price reflects both the production costs and the value I believe it holds. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I am initiating the trade with a proposal that aims to cover my production costs and includes a profit margin. By starting with a higher amount, I can negotiate and still aim to achieve a price that covers my costs and provides profit.

message: Dear Player RED, I understand that your resource is of high quality and appreciate the effort that went into its production. However, as a corporation, we aim to negotiate terms that are mutually beneficial while maintaining our budget. I propose a counteroffer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This offer takes into account the quality of the resource while also considering our fiscal responsibilities. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is at the maximum of what I'm willing to pay. It's a good strategy to try and negotiate for a better price to preserve resources for potential future investments or other expenses. Therefore, I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your need to stay within budget. I would like to propose a revised offer of 55 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price would still give you the quality you require while allowing me to sustain my business and production costs. I hope this meets your approval for a fair and beneficial deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but above my production cost. I will propose a slightly higher amount to find a middle ground that provides me with a satisfactory profit while still being attractive to Player BLUE.

message: Dear Player RED, I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate. I believe we are close to reaching an agreement that benefits us both. With respect to your production costs and the value of the resource, I propose an offer of 53 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This offer is a compromise that acknowledges the quality of your product while still adhering to our budgetary constraints. I hope this offer is considered fair and can conclude our negotiations positively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is slightly below the maximum amount I am willing to pay. While it's closer to my limit, there may still be room to negotiate for a better deal. However, I should also consider the value of finalizing the trade promptly without risking the deal by pushing too hard for a lower price. With that in mind, I'll make one more counteroffer that's beneficial to both parties but still under the initial maximum price I was willing to pay.

message: Dear Player BLUE, thank you for your thoughtful negotiation. I accept your offer of 53 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair agreement that respects both the value of the product and your budgetary considerations. I look forward to concluding this deal and possibly working together in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's offer is above my production cost and close to the price I proposed. Since the negotiation is nearing an end, and to ensure a sale is made, I am considering accepting the offer. Accepting 53 ZUP allows me to recover my costs and make a profit, which aligns with my goal. This proposal seems fair and is likely the best compromise to ensure a successful transaction.
