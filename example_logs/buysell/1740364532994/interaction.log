my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The corporation has proposed a trade of 50 ZUP for their product X. This is within the range I am willing to pay, but as a savvy buyer, I would like to negotiate for a better deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The customer has made a counteroffer which is above my production cost, but slightly below my initial asking price. Since it is important to engage in negotiations and show flexibility, I will make a new proposal that meets halfway between my asking price and the customer's offer, aiming to close the deal at a price that is profitable for me while also being acceptable to the customer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet halfway. To further our progress towards a fair agreement, I propose a slightly adjusted price of 46 ZUP for resource X. This offer is a step towards your revised price and continues to respect the quality of your product while staying within my financial means.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The corporation has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my target range but still higher than my initial counteroffer. I will make one more counteroffer to aim for an even better deal, which would still keep the final price within my maximum willingness to pay.
