reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the acceptable range of my goals. However, as a corporation, it is in my interest to negotiate the best possible price.

message: I appreciate your proposal and understand the need for cost-effectiveness. However, to reflect the value and production cost of the resource, I propose a compromise at 48 ZUP. This price ensures a fair deal for both of us, considering the quality of the resource I am providing.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to negotiate towards a middle ground that is still profitable for me. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above their proposal to find a compromise.
