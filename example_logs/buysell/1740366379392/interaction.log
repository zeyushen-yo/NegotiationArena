message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality product X that I believe will be of great value to your corporation. The production cost for this item was 40 ZUP, but considering its quality and the market value, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. I am open to discussing the terms if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to make a profit from the sale of my product, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to propose a starting trade that is above my costs to leave room for negotiation, but not so high that it scares off the potential buyer. I will start by asking for a bit more than my production cost.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for fair negotiations. While I believe that my initial price fairly reflects the value of the product, I am willing to come down slightly to 48 ZUP. This price ensures that I can cover my production costs and secure a fair profit margin for the quality I am providing. I hope this revised offer aligns with your valuation.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. This offer is close to my production cost, and I would like to make a profit. I will counter with a price that gives me a more comfortable profit margin but is still reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. In the spirit of fair trade and recognizing the quality of your product, I propose we meet in the middle with an offer of 46 ZUP. This offer should cover your production costs while also providing a reasonable profit margin. We hope this demonstrates our commitment to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down on the price, which is a good sign, but it is still below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your commitment to a fair and beneficial agreement for both parties. I propose a final counteroffer of 47 ZUP, which I believe represents the best balance between my need for a reasonable profit and your interest in acquiring a quality product. I hope we can conclude our negotiations with this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP which gives me a profit of 6 ZUP over my production costs. I would ideally like to secure a higher profit margin, but I must also consider the likelihood of completing the trade without prolonging negotiations unnecessarily. I will make one final counteroffer to see if Player BLUE would be willing to increase their offer slightly, while still keeping it within a range that they might accept.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000

We achieve a balance between cost savings and securing the product promptly.
