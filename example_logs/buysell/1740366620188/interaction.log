message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. I believe it could be beneficial for your operations. I'm proposing a fair trade that reflects the quality and the production cost of the resource. Would you consider purchasing it for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that gives me a profit over the production cost. However, I should also leave room for negotiation and not propose an excessively high amount that might immediately put off Player BLUE.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering the market conditions and our corporate budgeting constraints, I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade. Would you consider selling the resource X for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X is below the maximum I am willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Since it is within my budget, I could accept this trade. However, as a corporation, it's in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible. I'll try to propose a lower amount to save resources and maintain bargaining leverage for possible future transactions.

message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your constraints, but I also have to consider the quality and effort put into producing resource X. How about we meet in the middle and settle for 48 ZUP? This would still be a competitive price for the value you're receiving.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is above my production cost, which means I would still make a profit. However, since this is a negotiation, I will counter with a slightly higher price to see if there's room to increase the sale price while still securing a deal that's agreeable to both parties.

message: Player RED, I value the quality of your resource and your willingness to negotiate. In the spirit of compromise and establishing a long-term relationship, would you consider finalizing this trade at 46 ZUP? This price would reflect both the quality of your resource and our efforts to manage our expenditures efficiently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is still within my budget, and their willingness to meet in the middle shows a cooperative stance. The price is only 3 ZUP higher than my initial counteroffer and 12 ZUP below my maximum willingness to pay. It might be in my interest to accept this offer to secure the resource and foster a good relationship with Player RED for potential future dealings. However, I could attempt one more negotiation to see if there's room to lower the price further, ensuring the best deal for my corporation.

message: Player BLUE, I am pleased with your offer and your interest in a long-term relationship. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair price that reflects the quality of the resource and our mutual interests. Let's finalize the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer of 46 ZUP, which is close to my last proposal and still above my production cost, ensuring a profit. Given the interest in establishing a long-term relationship and the closeness to my previous counteroffer, it seems like a fair compromise to accept this offer.
