message: I have a high-quality item that I believe will be very valuable to you. I have set the price at a point that covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. I'm open to negotiation if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am making an initial proposal that covers my costs and includes a profit margin. I aim to make the offer attractive to Player BLUE while also ensuring that I do not incur a loss.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and the quality of the item you're selling. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer that aligns better with my budget constraints and the value I perceive from the item. Would you consider a price of 40 ZUP for the product?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a buyer, it's in my interest to negotiate the price down further to conserve resources for possible future transactions or needs. Starting with a lower counteroffer gives me room to negotiate and potentially arrive at a more favorable price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns and am willing to come down on the price somewhat. However, I need to maintain a profit margin to sustain my business. Let's meet in the middle at 45 ZUP for the item. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows me to cover my costs and gives you the quality you're looking for.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly my production cost, which doesn't leave any room for profit. I want to counter with an offer that still gives me some profit, while also moving closer to their budget constraints. A slight decrease from my initial proposal should still be acceptable for me, and might be more appealing to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my position and for your willingness to adjust the price. I think we're getting close to a deal. To reflect the value I place on the item and to work within my budget, I'd like to counter with an offer of 42 ZUP. I hope this can work for both of us as a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay. It's a good sign that they are flexible and willing to negotiate. However, I still aim to secure the best possible deal. By proposing a slightly lower price, I might be able to save even more resources while also leaving room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. Your offer of 42 ZUP is appreciated, and to facilitate a deal that is fair for both of us, I can lower my price to 43 ZUP. This would give me a modest profit while respecting your budget. I hope this offer is acceptable to you, and we can finalize our transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 42 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost. This offer would yield a minimal profit. Considering the negotiation process and the need for a compromise, accepting a smaller profit may be necessary to close the deal. However, I will propose a slightly higher amount in an attempt to reach a more favorable middle ground.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I am happy we could find common ground. Your final offer of 43 ZUP is fair, and I'm willing to accept it. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I look forward to future transactions. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from Player RED is for 43 ZUP, which is just one ZUP above my last counteroffer and well within my maximum budget. Since we are very close to the price I'm willing to pay and I want to maintain a good relationship for potential future interactions, it might be worthwhile to accept this offer to ensure a positive conclusion to the negotiation.
