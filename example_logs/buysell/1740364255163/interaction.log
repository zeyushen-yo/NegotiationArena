message: Thank you for your counteroffer. To meet halfway, I propose a price of 48 ZUP. This price ensures that the quality of the product is rightly valued while also respecting your budget constraints. I hope this can work for us both.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is above the production cost but below the initial asking price. I will propose a compromise that still allows for a profit while responding to the buyer's budget concerns.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is fair and I'm pleased to accept the offer of 46 ZUP for the product. I'm confident you'll find the quality to be exceptional and look forward to doing business with you in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is still above production cost and within a reasonable profit range. Since the goal is to sell the resource and Player BLUE has shown willingness to negotiate, accepting this offer could be beneficial to ensure the sale while providing some profit. This would also help maintain a good relationship with the buyer for potential future transactions.
