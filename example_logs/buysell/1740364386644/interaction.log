message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality product X available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade where you give 50 ZUP in exchange for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, I want to make a profit from the sale of my product, which cost 40 ZUP to produce. My initial proposal will be higher than my production costs to allow room for negotiation and to ensure I make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product X you are offering. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP in exchange for product X, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is fairly close to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as with any negotiation, it is generally expected to counteroffer with a slightly lower amount than what one is willing to pay to leave room for negotiation. I want to start with a counteroffer that is lower than 50 ZUP but not too low to seem unreasonable or disrespectful of the value of the product.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your perspective and would like to meet you halfway. Let's settle on 48 ZUP for product X. This price reflects the quality and value of the product while also respecting your counteroffer. I hope this revised proposal is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and their counteroffer. Their offer is above my production costs, but I aim to make a profit. I am willing to come down from my initial proposal but propose a price that's still profitable for me and closer to their offer, creating a fair middle ground for both of us.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Player RED. Your product certainly seems to be of high quality. To continue our negotiation, I'd like to propose a new price of 46 ZUP for product X. I believe this offer is fair and takes into account both the value of your product and my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement with this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession by lowering the price from 50 ZUP to 48 ZUP. While this is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, I still believe there is room for a slight negotiation to get a better deal. I will make a second counteroffer that is a bit higher than my first, but still below Player RED's latest offer, aiming to reach a more favorable middle ground.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I am pleased to see that we are coming closer to an agreement. I propose a small adjustment to 47 ZUP for product X. This price gives us both a fair deal, acknowledging the quality of the product and your budget constraints. I'm optimistic that this can be a satisfactory arrangement for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer of 46 ZUP, which is still above my production costs. I want to make a profit but also close the deal. Since we're nearing an agreement, I will make a slight concession to encourage Player BLUE to finalize the trade. This should hopefully be close to their maximum willingness to pay.

message: Player RED, I am pleased with our negotiation process and I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for product X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and I am looking forward to finalizing this deal. Thank you for your flexibility and understanding throughout this negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP which is quite close to my previous offer of 46 ZUP. This is just 1 ZUP away from my counteroffer and well within my maximum willingness to pay. Given that I want to secure the product and the negotiation has been progressively productive, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. It is important to consider the value of the product and the rapport with Player RED for potential future dealings.
