message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my high-quality resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I believe it's worth more than that. I'm starting with an offer of 50 ZUP, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's make a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for at least as much as it cost to produce, which is 40 ZUP. I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. The price of 50 ZUP for the resource X sounds fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Looking forward to future business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resource, and Player RED has offered it for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget. I can accept this offer, but I might consider negotiating to see if I can purchase the resource for a slightly lower price, which would be beneficial for my corporation. However, since the initial offer is reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay, accepting the offer would also be a sound decision. To maintain a good relationship with the seller and to secure the resource without risking losing the deal, I will accept the offer.
