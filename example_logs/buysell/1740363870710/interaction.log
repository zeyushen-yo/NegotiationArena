message: We have a high-quality product X that we believe will meet your needs. Our asking price is 50 ZUP, which we find reasonable considering the production costs and the value it provides. Let's negotiate if you have a different view on the price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, I aim to make a profit from the sale of my product. However, I must also consider the willingness of the individual (Player BLUE) to pay for the product. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a price that allows for a reasonable profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality of the product you're offering, but as an individual buyer, I have to consider my budget. I propose 45 ZUP for the product. If that doesn't work for you, I'm open to hearing a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by offering a lower price than their asking price, but still within a range that I am willing to pay. I'll start with a slightly lower offer to leave room for negotiation and to get a sense of Player RED's flexibility.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. We understand your budget concerns, so we'd like to meet you halfway. We propose a revised price of 48 ZUP for product X. This price reflects a fair compromise between our initial asking price and your offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is above the production cost, but below the initial asking price. As it is still profitable, I could consider accepting it. However, I will make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a slightly higher price, aiming for a middle ground between the initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. However, I'd like to counter with an offer of 47 ZUP for the product. This is a bit closer to my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown flexibility by coming down on the price. The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my target price range, and it suggests that Player RED is willing to negotiate. I will increase my offer slightly to move closer to an agreement while still aiming to get a good deal.

message: Your offer of 47 ZUP is acceptable to us. We believe this is a fair price for both parties involved. We are glad to have reached an agreement and look forward to future business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP below my last proposal and still above the production cost. This offer is close to my previous counteroffer and it is within an acceptable profit range; therefore, it would be reasonable to accept this offer to ensure a sale and maintain good relations with the buyer for potential future business.
