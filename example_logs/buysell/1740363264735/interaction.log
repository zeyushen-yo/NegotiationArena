message: Dear Player BLUE, we appreciate your counteroffer and understand your considerations regarding the market and budget. We propose a revised price of 48 ZUP for product X, which we believe is a fair compromise that reflects both the product's value and your budget constraints. We hope this meets your approval, and we can finalize the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above the production cost but below the initial asking price. To move the negotiation forward while still aiming for a profit, I'll propose a slightly higher price, splitting the difference between the initial asking price and the counteroffer. This should be seen as a compromise and hopefully acceptable to Player BLUE.
