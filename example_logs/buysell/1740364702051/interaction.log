message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality product for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I am offering it to you for 50 ZUP, ensuring a quality purchase for your needs. Let's discuss if you have a different value in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I want to sell my resource for more than the production cost to make a profit, I will start by proposing a higher price and then negotiate from there.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer, and I acknowledge the quality of your product. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP, considering the market and my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to purchase the resources at a fair price, but not at the maximum I am willing to pay right off the bat. By offering a lower amount, I leave room for negotiation, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your considerations regarding the market and budget. How about we meet closer to the middle at 48 ZUP? This price would still give me a reasonable profit margin while offering you a fair deal for the quality of the product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a lower price than my initial offer. To continue negotiations and move closer to a deal, I'll propose a price slightly lower than my original but still above my production costs to maintain a profit margin.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's settle on 47 ZUP, which is a fair midpoint between our initial proposals. I believe this price respects both your profit margin and my budget constraints. Looking forward to closing this deal at a price that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a good sign. I proposed 45 ZUP initially to leave room for negotiation. Since Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, I can attempt to meet in the middle of our two proposals, which would be around 46.5 ZUP, but since we are dealing in whole numbers, I'll round it up to 47 ZUP. This should be a fair counteroffer that edges closer to their asking price without hitting my upper limit.
