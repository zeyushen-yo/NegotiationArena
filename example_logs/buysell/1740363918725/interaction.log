message: As a respected corporation, we offer you our high-quality product X, which has been produced with the utmost care and attention to detail. We believe that an investment of 50 ZUP on your part would be a wise decision, ensuring you acquire a valuable asset. We are open to discussions and negotiations should you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a corporation, my goal is to sell my product for a profit. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a starting trade that gives me a profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation. I will start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP to see how Player BLUE values the object.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the high-quality product X and appreciate the opportunity to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of 45 ZUP to acquire the resource. I believe this to be a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the resource X, which is within my willingness to pay. However, it's standard practice to negotiate and attempt to get a better deal, especially since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will counter with a lower offer to see if there is room for negotiation.

reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but still below my initial asking price. There is an opportunity here to meet in the middle, which could be beneficial for both parties. I'll propose a slightly lower price than my initial ask but still above the counteroffer to aim for a profitable sale.
