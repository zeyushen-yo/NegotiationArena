message: I am offering a high-quality product X, which has been produced at a cost of 40 ZUP. I believe a fair trade would be for 50 ZUP, which includes my costs and a reasonable profit margin for the quality and value of the product. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I want to initiate the trade with a proposal that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin. However, I should also consider that the buyer, Player BLUE, will want to negotiate, so I shouldn't start with my minimum acceptable price.

message: I appreciate the offer for the high-quality product X at 50 ZUP. It seems like a fair price and I am happy to accept this offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my goals, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. The offer of 50 ZUP for product X seems reasonable and is below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the resources I need while staying within my budget. Therefore, I am inclined to accept the trade as it meets my objectives and seems fair.
